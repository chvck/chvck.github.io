As I've done \~800km on the levo now I felt like it was probably about
(past) time to service the shock and forks. Nothing hugely involved,
just an air can service for the shock and lowers for the forks. After
doing the shock my bike developed an odd knocking word …</div>

This is getting difficult now, once again I've done nothing of interest
today so nothing interesting to photograph either. I started making the
needles for the giant wool blanket, it took me all of a minute but
that's what my photo is today. We still need to work out how …</div>

Elysia up from work so decided to pop into Coffee No.1 whilst I waited
for her to finish. I'd only been once before. I had a decaff standard

we decided to have a go with it and see what's what. We tried a bit of
arm knitting but decided that we might be better off with needles as a)

Went for a ride out to nant-y-moch today, it was really low which was
odd. I'm still wondering why. The new tyres feel pretty awesome,
definitely preferring them to the plus tyres.

You can probably imagine how happy I was to find cake recipes in the oms
cookbook. I had a flick through and decided to make an orange cake
although I also added some cocoa to it. It's nice and has the texture of
normal cake so definitely happy!

The 50mph gusts showing on the weather forecasts should have put me off
riding, but they didn't. I didn't quite get as far as nant, I couldn't

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie>)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.

theyre generally pretty good I wanted to try something more square in
