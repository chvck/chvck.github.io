Today has been quite glorious weather so I decided this morning that I
was going riding. I hadn't fully planned on where just that I might try
to get out for a bit of a longish one. I rode a couple of things that I
don't normally ride and I remembered to continue avoiding the one of
them; rutty, boggy mess. Managed to get in a few river crossings too. I
did 57.5km with 2450m elevation gain so happy enough!
