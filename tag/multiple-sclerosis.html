This one isn't a happy fun time photo but part of the point of this was
as a partial ongoing log. It's an incontinence bed protector pad thing.
I've mostly got bed wetting under control but now and then it happens.
It's happened twice in last week (first time this …</div>

Screenshots count as photos right? Well, I think that they do. Well this

should be pretty easy to boost it …</div>
