</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I write posts somewhat sporadically and I'm quite good at forgetting how
my pelican setup works. For this reason I decided to change the
technology behind my blog. Moving away from using pelican and hosting on
github pages to <a href="http://postach.io/">Postachio</a>. Postachio is a blogging
platform that ties into a handful of sources, including dropbox which is
where all of my blog posts already are. It also accepts markdown as a
file type for posts, again suits what I already have. Postachio is free,
although I have opted to pay the small monthly amount to give a bit of
support. Unfortunately, at time of publishing this post it appears that
the Dropbox integration has been disabled for some time so this post
comes to you from a new source to me, Evernote!</p>
<p></p>
When I initially registered, got my posts on and changed my domain to
point at the new place there was no option for custom themes. The theme
editor was offline to be rewritten. I used a boilerplate theme from
their selection of precreated ones. A month or so later they unveiled
the <a href="http://help.postach.io/editing-your-theme-with-github">new theme
creator</a>. It's
quite rad really. You create a github repo that holds your custom theme
(you can also <a href="https://github.com/postachio">fork one of theirs</a> and
edit it) and then link your blog to it. Done! The templating language
is, once again matching what I already had experience with, jinja2.</p>
<p></p>
I forked the apex theme and spent quite a while trying to get a design
that I wanted. I wanted something simple and fully reponsive to all
devices, but I do not like messing about with CSS. I couldn't get what I
wanted and in the end I decided to just strip out as much CSS as I
possibly could. As close to bearbones as I could get and still have
something of a modicum of a design. I like it, I don't really care if
you do :p. Happy Christmas!</p>
