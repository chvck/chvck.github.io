Another normal day, fog still doesn't seem to have lifted from
yesterday. Elysia was out tonight so I was sat in work wondering what to
eat and quite fancied cajun spiced tuna steak with crispy potatoes.
Turns out that tuna steak isn't so easy to come by these days, so …</div>

You can probably imagine how happy I was to find cake recipes in the oms
cookbook. I had a flick through and decided to make an orange cake
although I also added some cocoa to it. It's nice and has the texture of
normal cake so definitely happy!

at 7pm on Sunday (!). I've had a flick through and there are loads of
good looking recipes ranging from snack bars to evening meals. It should

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie>)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.

snack once or twice too. I don't really like having breakfast early (as

It's almost actually not bad for you I think. The taste is quite nice,
