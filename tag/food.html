Another normal day, fog still doesn't seem to have lifted from
yesterday. Elysia was out tonight so I was sat in work wondering what to
eat and quite fancied cajun spiced tuna steak with crispy potatoes.
Turns out that tuna steak isn't so easy to come by these days, so I
bought a net of mussels instead. I still had my potatoes but I also
bought some nice olive bread.

You can probably imagine how happy I was to find cake recipes in the oms
cookbook. I had a flick through and decided to make an orange cake
although I also added some cocoa to it. It's nice and has the texture of
normal cake so definitely happy!

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie>)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.

The salmon was done nicely, "cooked" outside and raw in middle. This

It's almost actually not bad for you I think. The taste is quite nice,
it's not very sweet and it's fairly heavy. Next time I think I'll add
chopped oranges to give it pockets of sweetness. All in, pretty good
result …</p>

Today Elysia left her job so was feeling a bit down, I decided that I'd
