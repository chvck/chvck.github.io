I've decided to give up on the photo a day, day 50 seemed like a good
milestone to stop at. I wanted to try make each photo have a bit of
meaning/story to it and that was starting to become harder and harder,
not to mention that I didn't always manage that in what I did actually
do. I could see trying to find a photo getting closer and closer to arty
photos of the inside of the microwave and I didn't want that so felt it
time to bring it to a stop.
