This weekend is the dyfi winter warm-up, but I'm not riding it. Bean and
Steph entered but he messaged me a couple of weeks ago saying that we
should get everyone together and sell his tickets. So that's what's
happened, only Ben has come tonight, Rich tomorrow morning and bean …</div>

Today is Elysia's birthday. I'm cooking jerk salmon with steamed
veggies, salad and roasted sweet potatoes which should be nice. For her
present I bought her a pair of boots that she wants but I also wanted to
get her a little surprise. I was wondering what to get for …</div>

Today Elysia left her job so was feeling a bit down, I decided that I'd
take her out for some food. We went to Casablanca, a Morrocan
restaurant. The food and service were both really great, it's well worth
a visit if you're in Aberystwyth. We had hummus to share …</div>

First workday of the year. Problem with most workdays is that I go to
work and then go home and don't really do anything of interest. This
evening I went to PJM to have a tech meeting with Boomer. I think that I
hadn't been to PJM since my undergrad …</div>

Today my wrist/hand was giving me some issues so I decided not to ride.
Instead, I went for a brief, muddy, walk with Elysia around the woods at
Pwll Crwn. It's only a small wood so was only a short walk but it's been
a lovely day so it …</div>
