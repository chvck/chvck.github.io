            <p>Yeah, food is probably going to end up featuring quite heavily in this.
Tonight I decided that I could get away with it as this is something I
hadn't made in a really long time - <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/seabassandsalmoncevi_87098">salmon

It's almost actually not bad for you I think. The taste is quite nice,
it's not very sweet and it's fairly heavy. Next time I think I'll add
chopped oranges to give it pockets of sweetness. All in, pretty good

Today, Elysia and I went for another walk. This time we went to
Gogerddan woods to walk up the little hill. It was rather foggy so the
view from the top was, well, non-existant. It was a nice walk although a
bit muddy in places and my legs and balance …</div>

Yeah I forgot to post the photo again. For Christmas Elysia bought me a
mushroom log, these mushrooms are the first pickings. I think that
they're oyster mushrooms. They taste pretty good!

take her out for some food. We went to Casablanca, a Morrocan
