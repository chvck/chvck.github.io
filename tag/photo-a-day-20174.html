Today, Elysia and I went for another walk. This time we went to
Gogerddan woods to walk up the little hill. It was rather foggy so the
view from the top was, well, non-existant. It was a nice walk although a
bit muddy in places and my legs and balance …</div>

Yeah I forgot to post the photo again. For Christmas Elysia bought me a
mushroom log, these mushrooms are the first pickings. I think that
they're oyster mushrooms. They taste pretty good!

I bought the litmus paper because of a conversation I had with a

Today Elysia left her job so was feeling a bit down, I decided that I'd
take her out for some food. We went to Casablanca, a Morrocan
restaurant. The food and service were both really great, it's well worth
a visit if you're in Aberystwyth. We had hummus to share …</div>

First workday of the year. Problem with most workdays is that I go to
work and then go home and don't really do anything of interest. This
evening I went to PJM to have a tech meeting with Boomer. I think that I
hadn't been to PJM since my undergrad …</div>

Today my wrist/hand was giving me some issues so I decided not to ride.
Instead, I went for a brief, muddy, walk with Elysia around the woods at
Pwll Crwn. It's only a small wood so was only a short walk but it's been
a lovely day so it …</div>
