</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>About that time of year again, sure has gone fast! I was unsure how I
was going to ride it this year: see how quick I could get round or just
chill out and socialize. I knew that Ben and Steph would taking it at a
sociable pace so figured that I'd just ride the new bike and match pace
with them. Well, that didn't happen! I stopped for a toilet break on the
road out and the group rode on, somehow we all got separated, I managed
to pass both Ben's and Steph without noticing and it was only half way
up the first climb I figured that I passed them so just decided to crack
on. At the top of the first climb a familiar face caught me up, Harris
had appeared. We rode together for the rest of the event at a casual
pace and just enjoyed it. We figured that we must have passed Rich or
he'd gone off well ahead. At the finish line he turned up just after us,
he'd done the long loop. He spent the first half of the loop trying to
catch up with Harris, he gave up thinking that Harris must have been
well ahead. Hohoho we had a good laugh about that, well Rich less so!</p>

The ride was quite uneventful really, Harris got a puncture but that was
the only issue that we had. I had a bit of a moment down world cup when
I was certain I going to ride into someone walking down. If you're gonna
walk then that's fair enough but don't walk on the main line(s)! It was
definitely the hardest Dyfi I've done purely down to conditions, the
weather hadn't been good so the fireroads were like riding on glue!</p>

<p></p>
After the riding we had a beer and burger whilst waiting for Ben n Steph
and then once everyone was showered and beer'd we headed to the pizza
place at the Wynnstay. Jolly good it was too! Whilst waiting for Ben n
Steph we also managed to pick up a Dan as his train had been cancelled
so he was in need of a place to stay for the night. Was nice catching up
with him too.</p>
<p></p>
Another cracking Dyfi Enduro, big thanks to everyone involved in the
running of it!</p>
