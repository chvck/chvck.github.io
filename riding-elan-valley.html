		<h2><a href="/riding-elan-valley.html">Riding Elan Valley</a></h2> - <h3>Posted on Mon 28 March 2016</h3>
	</div>

      <p>A weekend or 2 ago I made plans to go down to South Wales and ride road
bikes with some old friends from Shropshire, as well as the weekend I
also had Monday and Friday off. We were staying a couple of miles south
of Builth Wells in the arse end of nowhere, but this meant that I was
driving through Rhayader to get there. This also meant that, on my way
down, the possibility of a ride in the Elan Valley was very much on the
cards. I did some hunting on strava and discovered a loop entitled
"Clive Powell's VERY challenging challenge ride 2016". The hint should
have been that this was a 40km loop that the guy had completed in 2
hours and even he thought that it was VERY challenging.</p>
<p></p>
I got to Rhayader at around 10:30-11 and did the usual faffing including
paying for a Â£3.20(!) parking ticket. I was expecting to know a few bits
of the ride from last year's transcambrian but very quickly I found
myself going off in a direction that I didn't know. I rode on roads for
long enough that I was starting to wonder if the route was actually a
road ride but stuck with it as it was a nice day and the views are great
so it could have been worse anyway... Nope, after a little while I
picked up a bridleway and was somewhat relieved. I rode through some
woods for a little while before embarking on my first descent of the
day, a really fast bit of dirt singletrack. Pretty nice.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
I was then met with a mixture of bit more road and easy track for a
little while. As a part of this track was the most swayingest suspension
bridge I've ever been on, it moved in just about every direction.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
After a while the route joined onto a hardpack, double track, bridleway.
This was a brute. A pretty steep, pretty long climb. Strava puts it at
11% for 1.1km, the segment is called "Breathing out of every hole to the
farm" and is quite accurate... At least the surface was decent and I
made it up without too much trouble although almost gave up during one
really steep bit, but I didn't! Through the farm and I rode along the
top of the one of the hills which offered some pretty rad views and also
encountered some rather stubborn cows that were not for letting me stay
on the road to get past them. This was followed by losing quite a lot of
elevation on a fireroad which didn't fill me with joy.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
I followed along a road for a while until I saw a steep road leading off
up the hill to my left, a feeling of inevitability crept in and then I
realised that I recognised where I was. This was the stupid steep road
that we'd done on the transcambrian. At 15% but only 0.6km I think that
it was actually easier than the farm climb was, I was glad to get up it
in one go. I followed the same route as the transcambrian for a little
while, starting out with a flatout grass descent on which I managed to
go the wrong way a couple of times.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
The route then climbed back up until undulating a little bit over
fields, offering fantastic views out over the reservoirs. I was
beginning to get worried that the route was going to continue following
the transcambrian onto my least favourite part of that day but luckily
it split right instead of left, hurrah! Instead of following down the
really rocky, hard going, double track, the route ran parallel on a
road. Much nicer. After a while it was time to go back offroad and into
another climb.</p>

<p></p>
This climb started out on tall grass in a bog. I was beginning to fear
the worst, a long push to get up the field. Luckily I pushed up a little
bit and a rocky doubletrack appeared, this was a relief as I could
actually ride it. It took me up for quite a while until I reached some
sort of weather station. After this the fun really began. The descent
started out as flatout down a grass field before going through a gate
and becoming dirt singletrack through the woods, across a fireroad and
into rocky singletrack. This was a great descent, really long and pretty
varied. Bits of it reminded me of the Dyfi. Definitely the best bit of
the day. At the bottom of this I crossed a dam and was faced with a
choice. Do I keep following the route or do I follow the road back to
Rhayader? I was feeling quite tired but it looked like the route
followed a cycle path the long way round to Rhayader so I thought that
I'd stick with it. Mistake. Big mistake.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
The route did follow the cycle path for quite a while before suddenly
turning off up a bridleway that there was no way I was riding up,
luckily the steep bit was only short and I was back on the bike on
doubletrack pretty quickly. This gave way to grass. I hate grass. The
climb was just steep enough, and me tired enough, that I was off and
walking, and walking, and walking. Walking uphill really messes with my
legs quite badly and my right foot was beginning to feel heavy and I was
having to pep talk myself into just keeping going. It seemed that this
moorland climb was endless but eventually I reached the top of it. It'd
gone cold and all I could see was more moorland. I was feeling pretty
demoralised at this point, but at least I could get on the bike and spin
a low gear so every cloud has a silver lining n that. It'd hit the point
where I was having to lift my right leg to put my foot on the correct
bit of the pedal and I couldn't lift my foot to the top of the stroke to
place it on the pedal any more either. This is starting to moderately
concern me as it seems to be happening more frequently as time goes by
but a bit of a rest and a section where I can spin and it usually
rectifies itself. I'll just continue to not think too hard about it!</p>
<p></p>
I followed the trail, for what seemed like forever, and eventually it
started to point downhill. By this point I was knackered and just took
it very steady as the trail descended to a road. I was very, very happy
to hit this road which was pointing downhill for quite some time. I
started riding down it for a while and I saw that I was off course. Sod
it.</p>
<p></p>
I pressed on assuming that it'd drop me into Rhayader, there were a
couple of moments where I was off the OS mapping on my garmin that I
have for the area where it looked like it was going to take me into a
different valley but it came sweet for me. It dropped a very cold, very
tired me into Rhayader. I rapidly packed the car and pressed on to
Builth, despite the heating being on full blast I think it still took
until near Builth before I stopped feeling cold.</p>
<p></p>
All in, it was definitely a VERY challenging route but I discovered a
couple of pretty rad descents. It's not a route I'm ever going to ride
again but I think that it showed me some good stuff and I did enjoy most
of it. The fella who I nabbed the route off on strava had managed to
complete the ride in under half the time that it took me! My garmin was
playing the "virtual partner route complete" jingle before I'd even hit
half way, had to laugh. Had I turned right instead of left at the dam
then I think that I'd have been pretty happy, a bit too much road for my
liking but fun and it really is an awesome place with fantastic views.</p>
