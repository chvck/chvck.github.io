	</div>

      <p>Another normal day at work, lovely day though. This evening I went out for food with Elysia to <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pizza25aber/">Pizza at no. 25</a>  as they're willing to accommodate vegan requirements. It's a small place which is effectively a takeaway (the pizzas some in boxes regardless) with some tables to sit at, which is fine with me!  I ordered the designer one; atrichoke, wild mushrooms, black olives and rocket lettuce with vegan cheese on half and no cheese on the other as I'm still not sold on vegan cheese (and looking at nutritional info afterward it's high in saturated fat anyway so will be giving it a swerve in the future). I also had a bottle of dandelion and burdock as I'd not had that in ages. Elysia has the bearded wonder; goats cheese, pesto and sun blushed tomatoes.  The base was nice and thin and the sauce was nice, it was a good pizza. Service was fast. There's not really a whole lot to say, pizza is pizza. Pizza at no. 25 is a very simple but effective setup.</p>
