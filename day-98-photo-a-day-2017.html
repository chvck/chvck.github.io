      <p>As the ebike is still off for warranty I decided to head out on my mega today.
The weather was really nice (I actually sunburnt) and I fancied toboggan and the secret descent.
I spent a while trying to get round the bottom corner on toboggan and I finally managed it!
I don't think it's going to be something I'm consistent at but at least I know I can do it. As
an added bonus I also found my lost glove just sat on the outside of one of the corners.
The mega is definitely easier to control on steep stuff. I rode the usual top of nant to the visitor
centre where I had a coffee and bumped into someone from work so had a chat too. Secret descent was
riding amazingly grippy and fast so I decided to also go a different way home. A bridleway along the rheidol valley
that I'd only ridden once before. I now remember why... It'd probably be quite nice if sections weren't churned up
by horses to the point of being unrideable but it was a bit of an adventure anyway and something a bit different.
<br />
Trying to decide on an image has been tricky as I took quite a few but I quite like the colours in this one and it's unlikely to be something I see again anytime soon.</p>
