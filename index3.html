I pre-ordered this cookbook at the beginning of January and it arrived
at 7pm on Sunday (!). I've had a flick through and there are loads of
good looking recipes ranging from snack bars to evening meals. It should
make my life a whole lot easier having a book of recipes …</div>

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie>)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.
