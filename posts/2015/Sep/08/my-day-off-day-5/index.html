      <p>Early start to get down to bike park Wales. We managed to get there at
around half ten and after faffing around were ready to ride at around
eleven. We were riding up rather than on the uplift as it's always
booked up and the ride up isn't so bad. This was the first time I'd been
there when it wasn't raining. We managed to get in 2 whole runs and 2
half runs which doesn't sound a lot but having done Cadair yesterday it
was enough.</p>
<p></p>
First up we decided to ride viscious valley down to the fire road. I
enjoy this trail, it's maybe a bit less rocky than others and a bit more
rooty. On the spin back to the top we decided to get another run in and
go down to the bottom to have lunch before the uplift stopped for lunch.</p>
<p></p>
Our run down to lunch was the new blue, Terry's Belly. Fair play to them
that is a seriously long run for the UK. It's pretty fun but the same
the whole way down really so did get a bit samey. Definitely a good
workout though, my feet were cramping by the bottom.</p>
<p></p>
Lunch was pretty good, we both went for the standard bike park Wales
burger. The burger was pretty tasty and quite dense so really filling.</p>
<p></p>
Haul back up to the top and we decided that we'd do viscious valley into
coal not dole as I remembered liking that trail too. I managed to ride
straight off the trail as it went into the trees, the contrasting light
left me totally blind! Well it was a good choice anyway, coal not dole
is fun, few small drops and quite fast. We decided to finish that run
off with deep navigation just to get our hit of rock, also a fun trail.</p>
<p></p>
After that neither of us fancied a jaunt back to the top so we just went
up to the fire road and we decided to do pork belly into the red to the
bottom. Pork belly was ok but nothing great really. The red was very
fast and had some decent sized jumps in it. I popped off of a rock
kicker not realising it was a double and duly landed on the up slope of
the landing, glad I was on the full sus!</p>
