    <h3>Posted on Sun 06 September 2015</h3>
        
      <p>Today was supposed to be BPW but as the weather forecast was looking
good we decided that we'd get Cadair done as that'd be miserable in
rainy weather. The first few km were road and then fireroad, that
changed to a couple of km of rutty, holey grass which was a bit push and
a bit ride up.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>

<p></p>
After that it was all pushing as it was nothing but rocks. To begin with
the rocks were kind of large like paving slabs made into steps but after
a bit become loose rocks of varying sizes, mostly baby head sized. The
view up was pretty daunting at this point but luckily the path wasn't
quite so bad...</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
The whole while pushing this bit we were scoping lines, lines that we
later totally ignored... On the video you can hear me shouting at Taylor
for taking the hardest line down the worst bit, I didn't realise until I
was already on it. Toward the top we started to be treated to some
decent views. We were nearly at cloud level so it was quite cool looking
out and having the top part of the occluded by cloud. Kinda hard to
explain, a photo does it better!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
We didn't go quite to the summit but got near, the very last bit was
quite busy with walkers and look quite difficult to ride so we just
didn't bother with it. The view from up there was pretty decent too!</p>
<p></p>
<img alt="View from the
top" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-xh69z2kmkbA/Vecr5bin-_I/AAAAAAAAJDs/uLXb-efzcxU/s640-Ic42/P1010158.JPG"></p>
<p></p>
It took us around 2 hours 40 to get up there, around 800m elevation and
12km distance. We had some food and then DOWN. The top rocky bit was a
little bit rad, properly technical and fun. At the bottom of that bit I
saw a view that I thought might make a nice panorama, so I photo'd it.</p>

<p></p>
After that it was still fun but nowhere near as good! We made our own
little off piste way down some of the grass just to make it a bit more
interesting and then it was just the fireroad. A good day out and one
I'm happy I've finally ticked off the list. Also pretty rad to have
ridden up and down a mountain in Wales!</p>
<p></p>
I stitched together some video of the top, it felt a loooot faster than
it looks! We also had a bit of a moment at the end of the video.</p>
