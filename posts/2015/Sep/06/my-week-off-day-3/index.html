Today was supposed to be the woods and Nant. Taylor said that he
wouldn't be around until a bit late on so we decided we'd do a nant
loop. It took me until around 3pm to actually get going and do anything,
I went to t<span>he woods</span> and had a rad couple of hours. Taylor
rang me to say that he'd be too late for a ride so I just stayed a bit
longer than I'd planned. I rode the same short section about 11 times it
was so good!

<p>Today I stayed over the side with the main lines on it and didn't
venture over the other side, I spent most of my time riding the top
sections trying to get them fast. I also decided to try out both lines
on the dual slalom track, I stacked it on both. More slippery than a
slippery thing!</p>

<p>Believe it or not but it took me 11 attempts to get round this corner
cleanly, even then it wasn't fast...</p>
