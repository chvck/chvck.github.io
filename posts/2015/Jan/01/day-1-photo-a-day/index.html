    <h3>Posted on Thu 01 January 2015</h3>
        
      <p>A new year has rolled around and once again I've decided to attempt a
photo a day. I strongly suspect that before January ends that I'll be
doing a photo a week but hopefully this'll drive me to get out more and
do some interesting things.</p>
<p></p>
So, day 1. I'm quite ill with this flu that's doing the rounds.
Typically on the 1st January I like to go riding but that isn't about to
happen, I feel better today than yesterday but want to get rid of this
ASAP. As such, today's photo is of a bit of bike fettling - bleeding the
brakes on my BFe. Reminds me, that I really need to sort out my
garage... With any luck I'll also be taking better quality photos as
time goes by!</p>
