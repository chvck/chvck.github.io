      <p>Hurrah I've managed a whole month of photos! Today I went for a shortish
ride up Nant, just toboggan and then over to the main trails and did a
Pendam loop. First ride on the 44s and, wow, they're properly nice. Had
to back the rebound off a touch as compressing the forks always wound up
with the front wheel in the air but they're like riding on a magic
carpet. Very happy with them. I managed to take a few photos today and
had all sorts of weather but my choice as my photo for the day is of
this bird. It was flitting around my feet eating the bits of cake that I
dropped, pretty rad!</p>
