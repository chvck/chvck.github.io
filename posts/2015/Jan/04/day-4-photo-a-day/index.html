</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today I was due to ride the Red Kite Frozen Devil but I made a call
yesterday that I was going to have to bail due to my cold. I arranged to
do a bit of nant ride with Andy as he was over this way surfing this
morning. I also really, really wanted to show him toboggan. We started
the ride with it and, as I expected, he had no problems and thought it
was great. The rest of the ride was quite good fun but I was taking it
very easy trying not to get out of breath and make my chest hurt too
much. It hurt a lot anyway and I generally felt quite rubbish so I
skipped High as a Kite and Hippity Hop. So, today's photo is Andy
looking out down the valley with a few red kites floating around.</p>
