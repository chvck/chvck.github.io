      <p>It finally arrived, my weights bench. I don't plan on doing any serious
lifting, I'd just like a bit more muscle for padding my bones when I
crash into trees, rocks etc... I'd also like to improve my core as
that's just generally useful in just about everything and hopefully will
also help a little with regaining my balance as I'm in a battle with MS
over that one. It seems to want to take my balance awa, I'd quite like
to just keep it so it's something that I'm going to have to put work
into trying to maintain. I'll just be using dumbells to begin with as
that's what I have, I have 40kg which should be plenty for me for now.
The bench is a <a href="http://www.ebay.co.uk/itm/261476031295">Bodygrip utility workout bench from
ebay</a>. The quality is decent and
it took about 25-30 minutes to put together using a couple of adjustable
spanners. All in all happy with it.</p>
