    <h3>Posted on Sun 11 January 2015</h3>
        
      <p>Yesterday I did a ride out to Nant and felt absolutely fine until I
really didn't. I was feeling quite good but taking it a little bit easy
when I suddenly just faded, my legs still had energy but I just felt
really tired. I still did the complete ride (I did skip one descent) and
pedalled everything fine but felt terrible, even got a 2015 KOM on the
top of white fridge. When I got home I pretty much collapsed onto my bed
(after taking off muddy kit!) for half an hour, and didn't feel better
for hours. Strange.</p>
<p></p>
This meant that I wasn't keen on riding today and instead decided to let
my body rest. I did some work on my big bike and did some painting
before going for a bit of walk in Gogerddan woods. I currently go
running (not regularly admittedly) in Cwm Pwll woods but they're very
small, about 1km per lap and totally flat. My explore of Gogerddan
turned up a waymarked walking route that I hadn't expected. It's around
2.5km long and does have a hill in it, so looks good for running. It is
a bit short but should do the job! The top photo is my photo a day for
today and the others are just a bonus.</p>
