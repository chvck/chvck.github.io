    <h3>Posted on Tue 13 January 2015</h3>
        
      <p>Today's photo is the view from my bedroom window this morning when I
opened my blind. Exciting stuff eh? Sun in Winter is always good, part
of the reason for choosing this photo is what happened with the rest of
the day. By 9 it was tipping down, by 10 it was snowing. The snow
persisted for a few hours and then blue skies! That was followed by hail
before going dark but dry again. I decided to drive up to Nant for a
ride and at the top of the mountain road it was, once again, snowing and
my car was showing it as -0.5C. I was somewhat concerned that driving
back down the mountain road later on would not be great so bailed and
just came home. It's just been hailing again.</p>
