      <p>Today was the Dyfi Winter Warmup. We left around 9:30 to give Taylor
time to try buy a ticket, luckily he was able to. We got there around
10:30 and signed on then we started riding at around 11. It was a rad
event and we managed 2 very sociable laps. The loop was really good and
took in Builth and 3in1 which are Dyfi classics, the first lap also went
down Elephant. On the second lap we did a cheeky little loamy trail that
runs alongside part of 3in1 which was really rad too. Top day out and
saw loads of familiar faces!</p>
