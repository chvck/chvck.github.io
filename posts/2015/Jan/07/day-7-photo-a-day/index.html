</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Beginning to feel better, hurrah! Been waiting for a package to arrive
all day today, wish it was with DPD - I'd know what time it was coming
then. Anyway, today's photo is of the state of my rear lawn. It doesn't
look great does it? Puddles, big blue bins and a bit of a mess in the
part that isn't lawn. My plan (before the ground gets dry) is to dig up
the lawn level with the garage and clear out the part that already isn't
lawn. This will give me an area to make a bit of a vegetable garden and
a proper compost heap, which means that the big blue bins can be
removed. I might use them for water butts but I'm not convinced that
I'll use that much water in the garden. I intend on digging up the
slabs, that presently exist as puddle bases, and I'll use them in the
vegetable patch. I'll use some of the dug up lawn to replace the missing
patches of grass that removing the slabs will leave. The washing line
pole and fence could also do with a bit of paint. Big plans, time shall
tell how well I get on - with any luck there will be a photo later in
the year with it all looking better and some vegetables growing!</p>
