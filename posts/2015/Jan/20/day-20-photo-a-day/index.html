    <h3>Posted on Tue 20 January 2015</h3>
        
      <p>Being away from home and spending all of my time in the office or where
I'm staying is making a photo a bit more difficult. Today we have a
photo of my Toshiba Chromebook. It's a good little machine. Boots fast
and I like ChromeOS. Aside from the trackpad it also feels more
expensive than it is. The only main complaint I have with it is that the
fan gets quite loud. I assumed that this was a fault and sent it off on
warranty but was stuck with a bill as they marked it as no fault found -
guess the volume meets their acceptable limits but not mine.  </p>
