      <p>tl;dr the postie arrived so I went riding...</p>
<p></p>
Looking out to the sea from the forest car park on the mountain road up
the Nant. I fitted my 10 speed kit to my hardtail this morning and then
went back to bed as I felt ill. I was about to write off the day when
the doorbell rang forcing me out of bed, post man! He bought me coffee
beans so I decided to have a coffee and a bacon sandwich and stop
feeling sorry for myself. I had left it too late to get a full ride out
in the light done so drove up to the forestry car park and did a Summit
loop from there. I really enjoyed the ride and definitely feel
recovered, although a bit slow, now. Also reclaimed my 2015 KOM on White
Fridge back from Dave! Not an overall PR but only 2s off, I'll get sub
30s eventually.</p>
