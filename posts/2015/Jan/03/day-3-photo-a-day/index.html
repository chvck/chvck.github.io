      <p>Still ill. Luckily, my first <a href="http://www.thespicery.com/">The Spicery</a>
box arrived today. I got given a subscription for xmas from my family.
The idea is that each month you get sent a box with the spices for a
meal, you buy the remaining ingredients and make the meal. There's a
choice of "Friday Night Curry", "World Kitchen" and "Date Night". For me
this was a choice of World Kitchen and Date Night, I have enough curry
spices as it is! Despite being single I went for Date Night as it's a 3
course meal for 2, so it'll do me for 2 nights.</p>
<p></p>
This month's box is Sri Lanka, the menu is: Tomato rasam, coconut and
fish curry and love cake. I'm quite excited to make this meal, it's
going to have to wait a week though! It also came with a little detox
spices sachet, the idea of these spices is a simple dish full of spices
to aid with digestion. The 2 dishes they suggest are a lassi and a dahl,
I'll be trying the dahl for lunch.</p>
