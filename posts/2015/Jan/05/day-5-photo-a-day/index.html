	</div>

      <p>First day back at work this year and, as expected, first day when I've
been a little lost what to photo. I'm still keen to not just take photos
or random stuff and want things that I can write a bit of something
about. So today is an indiscriminate bottle of clear liquid. I joke,
it's a bottle of the beer that I recently brewed. After seeing someone
recommend it online I used a <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bulldog-Home-brew-American-Double/dp/B00GTW7HCW">Evil Dog Double
IPA</a>
kit as I wanted to ensure that what I brewed tasted drinkable. The
procedure was quite simple -  </p>
<p>mix in bucket, put somewhere warm, siphon to bottles. The beer has come
clear quite nicely but once the cap comes off it goes really cloudy. Not
sure why! The bottles will be moved from the house to the garage soon to
see if being cool helps with that. The beer itself tastes quite nice
although tastes quite strong as well. It's very drinkable!</p>
