</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today, for some unknown reason, I decided to ride my road bike. I was
quite bored by the time I got to the end of Bow Street and very nearly
just went to Borth and back but I wanted to check out the climb from
Talybont to Anglers. The climb was quite long but not bad and it was
sunny so quite enjoyable really. As I rounded the corner at the top the
sun disappeared and it got really cold, oh and ice. I was taking it nice
and steady but on the road down to Nant-y-moch I hit a big sheet of ice.
As it was downhill I was gathering speed fast and despite knowing I
shouldn't brake I felt that I had to before I stacked it at a higher
speed, down I went. Bit of a grazed knee and my face hit first but
luckily my face landed in the snow on the grass as the side of the road.
By the time I reached where Syfydrin meets Nant-y-moch I was fed up and
decided that riding the loop backward was the quickest way to get me on
a road home. It was by far the most interesting part of the ride...
Despite the ride being rubbish and me confirming that I dislike road
biking I did manage to find a view I hadn't seen before and took a snap.</p>
