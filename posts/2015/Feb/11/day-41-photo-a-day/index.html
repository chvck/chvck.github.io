      <p>When I left aber today it was cold and foggy. It continued that way all
the way up through Banc y darren but pretty much as soon as I reached
the Nant area the clouds parted and the sun came out to play! I stopped
at the cafe for a, massive, wedge of cake and a cup of coffee - very
nice. I then decided to go out on the Syfydrin trail where I got some
amazing views over the lakes, a combination of fog and sun. After the
first part of the Bont Goch descent, at the gate, I stopped and realised
that there was complete silence. Not a sound to be heard, other than the
ringing in my ears - didn't realise how bad that was! It was quite an
awesome moment and really reminded me how important it was that I didn't
crash out there. Rad ride.</p>
