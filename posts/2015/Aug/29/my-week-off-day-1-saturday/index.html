Well I have the next week off so some biking is going to occur. Despite
being worried back in February that 10 days of holiday (not including
bank holidays) wouldn't be enough to last me 6 months it turns out that
I've rolled over 4 days into the new calendar year. As I haven't had a
week off since Feb I thought that I'd use these 4 days as it's a bank
holiday week. I've also managed to get Taylor to come join me from
Monday - Friday, riding is always better with other people! My plan of
action is:

</div>

<p></p>
<div></p>
</div>

<ul>
<li>Saturday - Brechfa</li>
<li>Sunday - Capel Dewi for digging and riding</li>
<li>Monday - T<span>he woods</span> in the morning and then meet Taylor
    at nant in the afternoon and ride a bit of the off piste too</li>
<li>Tuesday - Bike Park Wales without uplift</li>
<li>Wednesday - Cadair Idris</li>
<li>Thursday - Antur Stiniog uplift</li>
<li>Friday - Dyfi</li>
<li>Saturday - Maybe the Marin?</li>
<li>Sunday - Be depressed that the riding week has ended</li>
</ul>
<div>

Now a couple of these are weather permitting but should be a good week!

<p>So today, I went down to Brechfa with the intention of riding the red &amp;
black. First descent I almost had a bit of an incident as I slipped a
pedal off one of the kickery things, seems to be a tradition for to do
that off at least one of them now. Had a bit of pedal to shin interface
and just lost all power down that leg for a bit.</p>

<p></p>
<div></p>
<p>On the second(?) descent I did actually manage to have a stack. I
decided to double up a couple of whoops but my brain failed to inform my
legs of this decision. I landed on top of the second whoop and just lost
control a bit before landing on my face in the grass. Nothing bad
luckily!</p>

<p>Rest of the ride was pretty uneventful but was fun. I decided against
doing the black in the end as my legs were feeling a bit stiff and
wooden and I have another week of riding to go yet :)</p>
