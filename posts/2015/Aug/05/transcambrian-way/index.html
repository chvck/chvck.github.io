    <h3>Posted on Wed 05 August 2015</h3>
        
      <p>So this is a ride that's been in my sights for some years now, it's not
until recently I've actually acquired the level of fitness necessary to
give it a bash though.</p>
<p></p>
What is it?</p>
<p></p>
It's a 104 mile route that snakes across (and a bit up) Wales, starting
at Knighton (Shropshire border) and ending at Dovey Junction (near
Machynlleth). It's usually done as a 3 day trip so we decided to do it
in 1. We being Harris and I.</p>
<p></p>
We were far from being the first people to do this and there have been
some very, very impressive times done in the past. I think it's been
done in under 10 hours!</p>
<p></p>
Why?</p>
<p></p>
Well, firstly because I wanted to. Simple as. Also, though, it seemed
like a good opportunity to try to raise some money, and awareness, for
the <a href="http://www.mssociety.org.uk/">MS Society</a>.</p>
<p></p>
How'd it go?</p>
<p></p>
Brutal. Utterly brutal. I'd prepared for the distance, I'd prepared for
the elevation (OK I hadn't prepared for quite that much!) but I had not
prepared for the grass. It was a long, long ride but we managed it,
although we did cut to Machynlleth at the end instead. It was 2230 by
the time that we had hit the last point where we could go to Mach
instead of Dovey Junction so the choice wasn't difficult. So, from the
top...</p>
<p></p>
3am my alarm went off, I forced down 3.5 weetabix (couldn't face the
other 1.5), threw my food in the car and left for Knighton. En-route I
also picked up Ben. I don't function at all well before 7am so Ben's
attempts at conversation were mostly met by grunts whilst my brain tried
to shut itself down. We got to Knighton at around 4:30 without my
falling asleep and after faffage set off just before 5. I was feeling
pretty ropey at this point.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
I don't really want to write a blow by blow account so I think that I'll
pick some photos from the ride and just put down a few words about each.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
This first picture was one of the first climbs, it was one of many grass
ones. The one that we'd just got up was a hike with a bike, and also
grass! Draggy, draggy grass. For me, the grassy sections were the
hardest part of the ride by quite some way. The second picture is just
some sheep! After a while the grass gave way to dirt track which was
much, much nicer.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
Ahh river crossings, there were a few of these too although this was the
first of the day. Later in the day we had to pass through a quite deep,
fast one in the Hafren which I had a jolly refreshing lie down in. Less
than ideal!</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
This path was just after Rhayader so roughly 1/3 in and was a few,
welcome, quick kilometers on a fast surface away from the cars. After
all of that grass it was quite nicely different. The gpx route that we
were following was split into 3 parts, Rhayader marked the end of part 1
which was psychologically a big milestone. These milestones got a lot
more important the further in that we got; half way, end of part 2,
100km etc... Another big boost was reaching bits that I already knew.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
The cycle path took us to Elan Valley. I'd never ridden in the Elan
Valley before but have wanted to for some time. It was really quite
beautiful. We climbed up a meandering road for a while and gained a fair
bit of height before hitting, what was practically, a road wall. Blimey
it was steep! After that we wound up on... grass again! Although, after
the grass was a long flat track that was as rocky as a rocky thing which
at least kept the mind active trying to pick the way! Quite a few large
pools of water in this part of the world.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
The end of the track dropped us at the bottom of this dam. We had to
cross the river by riding through it before crossing it again on the
bridge. We rode round and up to the top of it before riding around the
reservoir itself to the other end. We to-and-fro'd with another couple
of guys at this point. Later on we caught them up again and had a bit of
a natter. They were riding day 2 of the transcambrian and were mightily
impressed that we were going for the lot in a day. We saw them a lot
more times and also wound up in a handy position where we'd open gates
and they'd pop up just in time to close them. A couple of more climbs
and I knew where we were! Up on the road above the teifi pools.</p>
<p></p>

<p></p>
En-route to the Teifi Pools (bottom pic) Ben managed to slice his tyre,
a pretty good slash n all. Luckily I had a tyre boot so we threw that in
and away we went. Actually, I had 2 boots which was a good job as he
later also sliced the boot! We followed the route that I'd done before
with the Ystwyth crew for a while before starting to head back toward
Llangurig. For some reason I'd thought this section would be really
easy, the bit from Cwmystwyth was pretty horrible but rideable though.</p>

Cool pigs nearish Pontrhydygroes!</p>

<p></p>
I've managed to skip a pretty huge distance here! Llangurig to Foel
Fadian but to be honest there wasn't a lot of note. A load of great
views but that's about it! Although it looked like there was some good
riding to be had in the Hafren Forest, and of course my little lie down
in the river. The top of Foel Fadian itself was covered in chippings
which was pretty exciting! After that it was flat out on grass and then
fireroad, I'd given up caring about self preservation by this point and
boy did the ground move fast! We continued on our merry way from the
bottom until we joined the fireroad that leads to the zigzag climb on
the Mach3 loop. The route went the opposite way to the climb (so did
we!) luckily. There was almost a crisis of sense of humor loss at this
point. I had thought the bit from here to Dovey Junction would be back
roads and easy, seems not. Took me a few minutes but I identified a road
straight to Mach. Instead of turning off the road after a bit to follow
the route we just kept on it to Forge and then Mach. With what I
estimated to be an hour riding left, on unknown terrain, we thought that
we'd best call it a day and get to our lifts. We only cut to Mach
because we were considering the people waiting for us, honest ;).</p>
<p></p>

height="3000"}</p>
<p></p>
Well that was it, that was the end. Coop car park. Man it felt good! A
phone call was placed, our lifts were in the pub together. I saw that
one coming but glad that they weren't just sat bored in the cars. 164km
distance, 3984m elevation climbed and 17h40mins total. Big day out! Glad
that I did, it's one to tick off but I won't be riding it again in a
hurry. It was very pretty but not really the sort of riding that I enjoy
most, a lot of descending was on road/fireroad which I had expected, to
be fair. Next weekend I'm going to everest the leg burner. That's a lie.</p>
<p></p>
Quite possibly best of all we also managed to raise just over £2000 for
the MS Society which is awesome, thank you so so much to everyone who
has donated.</p>
