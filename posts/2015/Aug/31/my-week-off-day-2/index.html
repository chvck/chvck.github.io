I spent around 4 hours today in the woods, half of that was probably
working on my new track. I've got one fallen tree left to take out and a
bit of dirt to pile on other and the top half of it'll be ridable. I
need to clear a bit of undergrowth and then properly cut in a rut and
it'll be done. It works well as the push up as is, much easier than
pushing up the other track and should open up scope for building a load
of other tracks more easily.

<p>After building I rode the steep line a couple of times and then the top
of Nick's into the rock garden track. Wasn't many runs but my legs were
pretty tired from the building so I left it at that, the slickness was
also scaring me a little!</p>
