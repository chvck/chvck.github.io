    <h2><a href="/posts/2016/Jun/21/following-up/">Following up</a></h2>
    <h3>Posted on Tue 21 June 2016</h3>
        
      <p>This post follows up on the last couple that I've written, a couple of
weeks ago I had two follow up appointments; one with urodynamics and the
other with the MS nurse.</p>
<p></p>
The appointment with urodynamics was made due to me having issues with
fitting the catheters so we decided I'd best go in to learn how to do
it. The appointment went well, started by going for a wee although this
time partially into a cardboard kidney tray thing. This was so that the
nurse could check for infections, it was all good! I then had the
bladder scan, this time it showed 70-90ml. This is a completely normal
level of urine to retain so we had a chat about how to proceed and
decided it's best if I keep going without catheters for now. Despite
this I still had a go with the little toy they use to demonstrate the
feel of pushing in a catheter, I can't really describe what it is other
than a tube you push the catheter down with an adjustable friction
"prostate" 3/4 of the way through it. As an aside, I also decided to buy
some <a href="http://www.tena.co.uk/men/products/male/tena-men-level-2">Tena men
pads</a> for
occasions where toilets are gonna be an issue. They're pretty low
profile and seem to work OK!</p>
<p></p>
The second appointment, with my MS nurse, was pretty short. On entering
the consulting room she commented on my gait as it's become a bit odd
sometimes, usually if I've been sat down and my legs have stiffened up.
We basically just chatted about how everything is going and I had to go
through and sign a form about my new meds to say that I understand
things like the side effects and how to take it etc... As I say, it was
pretty short and went well I think.</p>
<p></p>
The meds. Thought I'd also just write a bit about these. They've
actually been fine really, I get a burning feeling in my stomach
sometimes but not always and I get occasional toilet issues from them
but that one's rare. All in, pretty good really, to begin with I felt a
bit rough taking them for the first 1.5-2 weeks. I started out eating
poached eggs on toast with them for breakfast everyday but now I just
have a couple of spoonfuls of yoghurt with jam mixed through.</p>
<p></p>
All in, things seem to be going pretty well!</p>
