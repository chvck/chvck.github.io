    <h2><a href="/posts/2016/Apr/16/post-appointment-letter/">Post-appointment letter</a></h2> - <h3>Posted on Sat 16 April 2016</h3>
        
      <p>Yesterday I received a letter from the hospital, 3.5 days since my
appointment to the letter being with me - I swear they haven't been that
quick before! This is a letter from Dr Pearson to my GP, I get CC'd in
on it. The first thing that I noticed when I looked at it was that my
<a href="https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/expanded-disability-status-scale-edss">EDSS</a>
has dropped from 3 to 2.5, that's surely got to be good. I have mild
finger nose ataxia, which means I shake a bit going from index finger
touching nose to full arm extension. I also have slight pronator drift
in the right upper limb, and no I can't explain what that is. There's
increased tone in both of my legs but surely that could just be because
I ride bikes more than is, probably, wise.</p>
<p></p>
The next bit of the letter covers the new meds and possible side
effects. The final part is titled Plans. My bloods returned normal
which, whilst expected, is still a relief. Going to need blood tests
every three months I think. There's nothing else of note other than the
bit about my bladder scan. Dr Pearson says that he thinks that I require
intermittent self-catheterisation. The prospect of ramming a tube down
my urethra doesn't fill me with glee but, in all honesty, it'll be a
massive load off my mind. The ability to go into situations without
worrying about if I'm going to need the toilet or even if there is one
is not something to be easily dismissed. I hadn't really realised how
much of game changer a slightly broken bladder could be, until it
happened. I think that this is going to be subject to what the
continence team think too so I'll have to see how that develops. I'm
actually kind of hopeful for the catheter, as odd as that may sound.</p>
<p></p>
All in, pretty positive I reckon.</p>
