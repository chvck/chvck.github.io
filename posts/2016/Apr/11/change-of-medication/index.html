		<h2><a href="/posts/2016/Apr/11/change-of-medication/">Change of Medication</a></h2> - <h3>Posted on Mon 11 April 2016</h3>
	</div>

      <p>Today, I had an appointment with the MS team down in Swansea Morriston
hospital. I had 2 goals going into the appointment; get something to fix
my bladder and change my MS medication. I got to the hospital and spent
5 - 10 minutes trying to park before just abandoning the car outside of
a bay but out of the way, I wasn't the first or only person doing this.
The system here at the hospital has all changed, outpatients is now
right next to the car park and it's a self check in deal with a main
waiting area filtering into smaller waiting areas. It's a lot slicker
than it used to be. I checked in and sat down to almost immediately be
called to the next waiting area. I was waiting in there for around 5
minutes before being called to my appointment. Pretty damn painless.</p>
<p></p>
In the appointment was Dr. Pearson, a student doctor and Pete (a nurse).
After pleasantries and general discussion on how it's all been since my
last appointment we got onto medication. It would appear that there have
been three new medications, that I'm eligible for, since my last visit.</p>
<p></p>
The first is another injection but is every 2 weeks rather than every
other day, which is what I'm on now. This has similar side effects and
effectiveness to the betaferon that I'm taking.</p>
<p></p>
The second is an oral medication taken daily. It also has similar
effectiveness to the betaferon but requires blood tests every 2 weeks
which quite rapidly ruled it out.</p>
<p></p>
The third was another oral medication, taken twice daily and is what
I've chosen to go for so long as my bloods come back OK for it. It's
called
<a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/treatments-and-therapies/licensed-disease-modifying-drugs/Tecfidera">Tecfidera</a>.
The active ingredient in it is called dimethyl fumarate, which isn't an
overly nice substance. The relapse rate is reduced by 53% and disability
progression by 38%, which seems pretty good to me as I'm a big fan of
having use of my legs. However, it comes with side effects. It
effectively burns it's way down the GI tract, any part of which can
react in it's own way. Be it heartburn, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc... It
also, very commonly, causes flushing so I'm going to be doing my best
tomato impression - with a sidenote of possible burning/itching effects.
So, that's all going to be fun but worth it I hope.</p>
<p></p>
Tecfidera also comes with the very rare side effect of developing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy">PML</a>
which is why I'd ruled it out during my own research. Dr Pearson was
able to suitably put my mind at ease on that one, it really is very
rare. They also know what's happened in previous cases where it's
developed and have measures in place for monitoring patients to catch it
before it happens. The Swansea team seems to be especially cautious on
this front.</p>
<p></p>
After that discussion he did all of the normal reaction, feeling etc...
tests which showed that my balance is becoming a bit screwed and I have
some tremors, nothing that I didn't already know really but slightly
concerning anyway. I mentioned that my bladder is doing my head in and
actively altering my lifestyle and I had a bladder scan (after emptying
said bladder) with Pete. A normal person retains 100ml or less of urine
in their bladder, I had 169ml in mine. Stupid, greedy bladder. They're
going to refer me to the continence team in aber. I also get to go for
another MRI scan, I hate those. 1.5 hours of not moving and certainly
not going to the toilet. I managed to fall asleep in the machine last
time, that makes it a lot more tolerable.</p>
<p></p>
He also mentioned that guys who are a bit wobbly, like me, tend to have
a slightly harder time of it in the future so it's really important to
find a medication that works for me, now. If a disability occurs then
it's too late by that point, can't reverse it but can slow or maybe stop
it happening. Not words I really wanted to hear but important to know I
think. He suggested that I do stretches as that'll also help, luckily I
already do but it's dropped to maybe 50% of days so that'll be changing
back to at least once a day.</p>
<p></p>
Next up was the bit that I knew was going to result in a wait, blood
test. I went to check in for the blood test and was told there was a 1.5
hour wait, that wound up being 2 hours but that's life eh. All in all
not too bad and hopefully should start on the new meds in a couple of
weeks time.</p>
