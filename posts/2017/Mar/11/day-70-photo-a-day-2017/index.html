	</div>

      <p>Today I went to the Dyfi forest with Paul and a work colleague, Ioan. Upon arriving
in the car park I turned on my bike to find that it hadn't been charged - the plug
socket must have been turned off. Well, that wasn't going to stop me so we threw the battery in the car
and I endeavoured to ride a 20kg bike. I really didn't expect my legs to be in a good state by the top of the
first climb. They were fine for almost all of the ride though! This really, really surprised me and I'm not sure
why they held up so well. My general fitness also seems to be pretty decent, I wasn't blowing up on any of the climbs
and wasn't going really slow either. We managed around 17 miles with 1000 metres of elevation so not exactly an easy ride either.
<br>
<br>
What I didn't do was take a photo, d'oh! So, here's one of yesterday evening's handywork!</p>
