	</div>

      <p>This morning was really nice weather. I pottered around for a bit then headed out on my bike.
I wasn't really sure what I wanted to ride other than just the standard nant trails, I had an idea
to ride up to angler's retreat and do the figure of 8 up there. However, on the way out I
also decided that I quite fancied a steep trail near nant so decided I'd do that first.
It was riding really nice but by the time I'd climbed out of the bottom of the valley the weather looked
like it was going to turn so I decided I'd head to the visitor centre via the usual trails plus an extra one. I was
right the rain and the wind came in! After reach the visitor centre for an espresso I decided to head back
via the secret descent. Seems they've cleared a down tree and a load of brash on it which was pretty cool! All,
really fun ride despite the very mixed weather.</p>
