	</div>

      <p>Well, following on from yesterday's escapade into gardening today I went from work to 
<a href="http://www.charliesdirect.co.uk/">Charlies stores</a> to buy a lawn aerator. My rear lawn is basically
becoming a bog and moss is slowly taking over from grass. A friend suggested aerating it, the tool
is only a tenner so I figured it was worth a go. Unfortunately the problem with places like Charlies is
that it's impossible to go in and only come out with what you went in for. So I now also have a new bow
saw and a pair of gardening gloves (my old ones were full of holes, not great for pulling brambles). Still, less
than 15 quid spent so not too bad!
<br>
<br>
The lawn is now full of holes so hopefully that'll help. I also removed another little shrub and started work on the trees.
I've taken one down by chopping off all of the fronds individually so I can actually dispose of them, I still need to cut out more
of the trunk. That'll be tough going. Certainly already looks better in my opinion.</p>
