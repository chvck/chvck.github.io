Today is Elysia's birthday. I'm cooking jerk salmon with steamed
veggies, salad and roasted sweet potatoes which should be nice. For her
present I bought her a pair of boots that she wants but I also wanted to
get her a little surprise. I was wondering what to get for a while and
yesterday I stumbled across a little plushie pikachu. Well she likes
plushies and she likes pikachu so I went with it, I think that she likes
it!
