      <p>I spent a fair bit of yesterday afternoon and most of today getting
Unreal Editor 4 to run so there's no way it's not going to be my photo a
day! I started out in fedora 24 and kept getting the error
<code>LLVM triggered Diagnostic Handler: unsupported call to function exp10f in main</code>,
I wound up formatting and installing ubuntu and STILL got it.  </p>
<p>That did not please me.  </p>
<p>Whilst the editor would run the create/open project screen it'd bomb
with that error in the logs when I tried to open or create a project.
Anyway, that's jumping the gun a little.</p>
<p></p>
Googling this issue didn't throw up a whole lot but one of the, few,
hits hinted at graphics drivers. I have a radeon rx200 graphics card and
it seems that the AMD proprietary drivers have been dropped in both
fedora 24 and ubuntu 16.04+ (I'm using ubuntu-gnome 16.10). The open
source drivers seem to be good enough though, I've been playing Heroes
of the Storm through wine without issues. I spent a fair bit of time
poking around my system and googling various things, I somehow got into
looking at opengl. I saw that my system was using a version of mesa that
gave me opengl 3. I saw that UE4 had an opengl4 flag so decided that it
had to be worth a go as I was pretty sure the error was related to
graphics. In the end I tracked down the Oibaf PPA which offered up a
newer version of mesa and llvm. I thought that it looked promising and
then came across <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/forums/showthread.php?23665-How-to-update-Open-Source-graphic-driver-in-Ubuntu">this link on the epic games
forums</a>
which validated it a bit so went for it. The step missing in that guide
that I needed was to do an <code>apt-get dist-upgrade</code>. After doing that I
rebooted and started UE4 again, created a project and hey! there we go,
it works.</p>
<p></p>
Here it is in all of its glory.</p>
