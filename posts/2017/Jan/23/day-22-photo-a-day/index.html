      <p>Today I went to ride the masochists trail at myherin with Ben, Rich,
Bean and Steph. It was great, the trails were running well and even the
tech climbs seem to have been smoothed out a bit. The weather was cold
but dry, there were patches dusted with snow. The ebike meant that I was
able to get up all of the climbs on eco mode. We had some good views
from the top at cefn croes windfarm, so here are some.</p>
