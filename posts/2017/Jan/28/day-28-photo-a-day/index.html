For my 30th one of the presents that my family got me was a framed beano
comic that was released the day that I was born. I used to read the
beano quite a lot and still have quite a few of the albums somewhere.
Little did they know that many years ago my Mum also got me a copy of
the same beano which I'd been meaning to frame for years but this means
that I can still flick through that one and find something else to do
with it. Anyway, today I decided to get round to hanging it.
