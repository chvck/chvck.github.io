    <h3>Posted on Wed 18 January 2017</h3>
        
      <p>A pretty standard day really so not much exciting again. 2 litres of
cold pressed flaxseed oil! I've frozen 1.75 litres of it as it doesn't
keep for long. Why? That [oms diet] (http://overcomingms.org) again,
flaxseed oil is very high in omega 3 fats and they recommend 30-40ml a
day of it. 2 litres cost me 50 quid so it's far from cheap but hopefully
it'll be worth it in the long run. I'll probably use it to drizzle over
food as well eating it straight from a spoon. The taste is nice, quite
nutty, and it doesn't coat your mouth in a film like some other oils
would do at least it's easy to take.</p>
