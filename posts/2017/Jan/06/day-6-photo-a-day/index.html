</footer><!-- /.post-info -->      <p>Today I received me some post! What I got was maybe a bit unusual; a
pack of litmus strips and a vitamin d test kit. Why? I'll tell you why.</p>
<p></p>
I bought the litmus paper because of a conversation I had with a
colleague at my works christmas meal. We were chatting and I mentioned
that I have MS, he asked me if I'd ever tested my pH level - I had not.
He went on to talk about body pH level and the importance of it and
suggested I got some and tested myself. I figured nothing to lose, may
as well take a look as it can't hurt to do so.</p>
<p></p>
The vitamin d test, well I could waffle about this for quite a while but
I won't. Long story short I've started following the
<a href="https://overcomingms.org/">overcomingms</a> diet/lifestyle as quite a few
people report good success with it. The book is quite compelling and it
all appears to be evidence based, albeit case studies. As someone who
knows not a lot about this stuff it's difficult to know but it's
something to give me hope so I'm running with it. The importance of
vitamin d levels in MS is stressed quite highly and, although I do
already take 5000IU of vitamin d daily, I thought that I may as well get
myself tested to find out what level I'm at. It's a pretty simple test,
prick finger, dab blood in three spots and send off to an NHS clinic,
simples.</p>
