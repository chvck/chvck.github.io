Lately I've been questioning if I eat enough calories during a normal
day. I tend to just eat two (big) meals a day plus a bit of fruit as a
snack once or twice too. I don't really like having breakfast early (as
in before work) it makes my feel a bit unwell and I don't really have
time anyway as I'm pretty useless at getting out of bed. For this reason
I decided to make some breakfast bars that I can just grab one of and
eat whilst I'm putting together my flask of coffee. Trying to find a
recipe actually wasn't as easy as I expected, due to needing it to be
vegan and low fat. A lot of recipes seem to have coconut in them. In the
end I went for
<http://www.ihcbesthealth.com/articles/baked-oatmeal-breakfast-bars-vegan/>,
although I replaced raisins with blueberries because ugh raisins. Due to
my oven being quite rubbish I think that they could have done with being
baked for a bit longer but that's something I know for next time.
