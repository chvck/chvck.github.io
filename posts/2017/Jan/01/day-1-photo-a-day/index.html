Another year, another attempt. Hopefully I'll do a bit better this year
but I doubt it!

<p>As it's new years day I decided to go for a ride. It's been a pretty
warm day although quite a lot of wind, and the wind is coooold. Had a
fun ride and mostly stayed dry too. i bumped into someone I work with
and had to turn the bike to turbo just to keep up with him so that was a
decent workout and good to spend some of the ride chatting. Got a few
PRs and only nearly crashed a couple of times so pretty good! This photo
is one I've taken many, many times now but it's still a view that I
really like.</p>
