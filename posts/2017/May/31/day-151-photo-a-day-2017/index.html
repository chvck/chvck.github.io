      <p>I got home and decided to check on the veggie patch, the mixed salad bits are doing well! They've grown considerably since I last checked them. I had to do a spot of weeding as there were a couple of dandelions sprouting up. In hindsight I maybe should left them and just ate them too but I was a bit worried they'd steal resources from the other plants. I was in a bit of a productive mood so I also went to the garden centre to pick up some more top soil, and I bought a bell pepper plant whilst I was there - because why not. I want to get some chilli plants as I seem to be incapable of growing from seed but they don't sell those.
<br />
<br />
Using the top soil I finally finished filling in the holes in the lawn and also sowed some grass seed. So today's photo is the lawn as it stands at the moment, I'm hoping in a couple of months time to have an after shot with grass growing!</p>
