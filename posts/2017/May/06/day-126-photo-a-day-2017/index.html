      <p>I actually had quite a busy day today. I woke up quite late at 9:15 having
got around 10 hours of sleep! I cleaned up and photo'd some bike bits that I want
to sell. Just as I finished doing that Elysia rang me and asked if I wanted
to go for lunch with her. Yes, yes I did. We went to Baravin, I was disappointed
to see that my favourite had been taken off the menu but the soup of the day
was carrot and coriander with sourdough bread. So I went for that and it was very nice,
I also had a cold brew coffee - I always forget how nice that is. In the afternoon
I spent most of the time doing gamebuildr but as the evening approached I decided
that I wanted to ride my bike. I really couldn't get enthused about riding nant.
I remembered that the Ystwyth ride just gone went somewhere that I'd not ridden before,
starting from tre-ddol which is a short drive away. I loaded the route onto my garmin
in the hope that the battery would last the ride and set out. Sorted!
<br />
<br />
I got there to find my rear flat completely flat and the garmin refusing to load
the route. I shoved some air in the tyre and had a bit of a fiddle and it seemed to
be holding air and I set out in the hope that the garmin would sort itself out.
I was straight onto a dirt trail, dirt - yes! I was really hoping for dirt trails
rather than rocky ones. Halfway up the first (singletrack!) climb my garmin
started working. Things were looking up! The loop was really fun, the descents were
great and mostly techy. There were some fantastic views over the estuary from
on the top. A route that I'll be doing again for sure and I might try to
find some more stuff over there too. My legs now have that after exercise glowing
feeling, I can't remember the last time I felt this. They usually just have a
deep, dull ache!</p>
