      <p>Nothing exciting yet again. Had hoped to get my bike back as Specialized say
they've fixed it, maybe tomorrow. I think over the last 5 weeks it's been in my possession
for 3 or 4 days. We've also had glorious weather the last couple of weeks and
now it appears that the weather is turning for the foreseeable. I'm quite
disappointed about it but not much to be done.
<br />
<br />
As it's been an uneventful day I'm falling back to my list of things to photo
when I have no ideas. So today is of my meds, <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/treatments-and-therapies/licensed-disease-modifying-drugs/Tecfidera">Tecfidera (dimethyl fumarate)</a>.
I think that they're doing the job as I've had no relapses and I don't think
that I have any side effects from them either. I certainly haven't contracted <a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/glossary/letter_p#PML">PML</a>
which is a rare but worrying side effect. The MS team monitor my blood levels for any
sign of activity that lead to contracting it so I'm not really bothered about
it though. I have an appointment with my neurologist next week so we'll
see what he thinks. I'm also going to see what he thinks about the overcomingms
diet, that could be interesting!</p>
