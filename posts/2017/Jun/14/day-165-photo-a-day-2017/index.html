      <p>This evening I went for a ride on the Levo. It was going great, toboggan was riding great and the weather was nice. I decided to head out the top of nant on the Syfydin route. As I climbed up to the Bont Goch descent I was trying to choose between it and the bridleway. In the end I decided to take the Bont Goch descent, might have been a mistake! There was immediately a fair bit of water erosion and picking a good line was difficult. After I rounded the first left hander and was approaching warp speed I spotted a really big hole, too late. I slammed on the brakes but no way was I near to stopping, straight into the hole and very, very, luckily just about out the other side. I wound up running whilst still straddling the bike and I totally bottomed out my forks. Feel quite lucky I got away with it.
<br />
<br />
About 3/4 of the way down the descent I hucked off some rocks and just after I landed I felt the rear wheel buck out as I hit a big rock. Very soon after I realised I had a total flat. Annoying. Oh well, fit a new tube. Won't go up properly. Has a hole in it. I carry puncture repair stuff so I tried to repair it but no luck. Wound up riding the whole way home on a flat, think I might need a new tyre now :(</p>
