	</div>

      <p>I was still off work today and decided that I'd have a nice relaxing day,
maybe play some video games. I had a quite productive day instead. I finally
went to the tip with all of the fir tree that I chopped down. I cleared weeds
and soil from the gaps between the slabs on the patio and brushed the patio. I
went to the garden centre with Elysia to pick up some top soil and compost, and
also had a coffee there. I started filling in the big holes in my lawn with said top soil,
I'm going to need more. I'm also going to need to remember to buy grass seed. I hoed
the veggie patch and a couple of the smaller little bits in the patio and mixed
some compost into them. I planted some mint, basil and holy basil, hopefully they'll
grow! I slow cooked a chili and rearranged some of the kitchen. 
I also did some gamebuildr and had a gamebuildr meeting. Not such a relaxing day after
all!</p>
