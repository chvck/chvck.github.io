      <p>As my mega is most definitely out of action I decided to try go for a ride on
the ebike again. I knew where I want to go, just not how I wanted to get there
or back. I set off out toward Capel Dewi and the bike seemed to be behaving,
I decided that I was going to head to the top of nant via Zorro. Once at the top of
Nant I had a few options on which way to go but I decided to just follow the Syfydrin
trail out to Nant-y-moch and then keep following the road to Nant y cagal. At that point
I decided to try ride up the steep techy climb as a) it's shorter than the road round and
b) I was on an ebike. I also managed it, but not quite. From there I just followed my usual
way out to the Mach 3 loop and The Chute. It was a nice clear day and the views were good.
I even got treated to a close up of a kite. The chute was, as always, really fun. 
<br />
<br />
I was a bit torn about which way to head home, I'm not a big fan
of Scaletrix but I knew that following the Mach 3 and then heading back the way
I came would involve lifting over more gates than I wanted. I'd already had to
lift over quite a few. I devised a plan to head to Hyddgen sheds but to keep
going down the side of Nant-y-moch rather than go along Scaletrix. After that I
decided to ride the field section of Joe's Back Garden backward, something that I'd
never done before. Something that I'm in no rush to do again. It wasn't bad or anything,
it just wasn't especially exciting either. Ice rink, toboggan and home. Ebike decided
to stop working on the final climb up to my house which wasn't great but manageable.
All in managed to do 75km, a nice day out! </p>
