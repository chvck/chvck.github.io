      <p>I knocked off work at 3 so that I could get straight up nant. As mentioned, I took my mega TR with me. The shock seems to be in less
than ideal condition! Anyway, the skills area was pretty busy and I rode all of the lines. Does seem that I can longer remember how to
ride jumps though... It was fun watching the people who most definitely can though and the lines are pretty friendly so attempting
to jump doesn't result in gruesome death anyway. I also did a run of high as a kite which felt good on a much lighter bike than I usually ride!</p>
