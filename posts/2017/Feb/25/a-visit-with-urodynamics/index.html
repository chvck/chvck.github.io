On Thursday I had an appointment at the Urodynamics department in
Bronglais. I actually managed to park in the hospital car park for once
(yes, I drove the mile there. You try walking that far in an urban
environment with a bladder that gets upset by walking!) so was already
entering the hospital via a route that I didn't know. I eventually found
my way to the usual outpatients entrance to find it all being
refurbished and closed off. After around 15 minutes, and being guided
there, I was in the right place. One great things about these
appointments is that there's no wait at all so I was straight in with
the nurse.

<p>We had a brief chat and then scanned my bladder, she sent me off to the
toilet and then scanned again. 130ml residual this time, which is better
than when I was scanned at Morriston and really isn't much (neither is
169 really) retention. After that we looked at my intake/output diary
for the previous 3 days (yup, that means recording volume of drinks and
then volume of urinations too), she was pretty happy with the quantity I
output in one go. I seem to average 250-300ml which is fine. We
discussed cutting out certain drinks, mostly my coffee habit. Caffeine
irritates the bladder so we decided that I'd only have 1 coffee a day -
a strong one in the morning to wake me up. I'll also only have one cup
of tea a day, I'm ok to drink decaff tea n coffee though.</p>

<p>We got onto the topic of intermittent catheterisation, she isn't sure
it's going to do a lot for me and neither am I. Regardless, we decided
that I should give it a go and see if anything improves. Intermittent
catheters (at least of the type I've now got) are for getting rid of
retained urine. You insert it, drain off the residual and then remove it
again. She got an intermittent catheter for me to look at and it didn't
look too scary and was very, very slippery. I was also armed with a
booklet and a DVD on how to go about using it. She said that she could
either make an appointment and we'd go through everything and she'd help
me the first time or I could just take a few with me and do it myself if
I was feeling brave. I figured that there can't be much to it so took
them with the intent of reading the information and watching the DVD
before having at it.</p>

<p>I tried it for the first time on Friday morning, I was expecting a bit
of a struggle to insert it into my urethra but it just went straight in
with no bother. Didn't hurt at all either, could barely feel it. UNTIL
it stopped and I couldn't get it go further, not that I tried very hard,
I wasn't about to try forcing anything... It didn't hurt but as a I
pushed a bit I felt very nauseous and quite light headed so I pulled it
back out again. I didn't fancy throwing up with it in place! Some
googling has suggested that it got stuck at the prostate/bladder
entrance and to try relaxing those by changing position and/or trying to
have a wee to open things up.</p>

<p></p>
<div></p>
<p>I tried again Saturday morning and got the same result. I decided to
take a break on Sunday and tried again the Monday night, thinking maybe
things might have relaxed during the day. Nope! Same problem but at
least no sick feeling this time, just the feeling of resignation when I
had to give up. I stopped after that attempt and now have an appointment
in a couple of weeks with the nurse and we're going to fit it together.
That'll be different...</p>
