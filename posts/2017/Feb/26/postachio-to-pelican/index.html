		<h2><a href="/posts/2017/Feb/26/postachio-to-pelican/">From postachio to pelican</a></h2> - <h3>Posted on Sun 26 February 2017</h3>
	</div>

      <p>I've got a bit fed up with the lack of control that I've had when using postachio, there's metadata that I want in my templates that 
I can't have. Despite promises that they were going to improve things toward the end of last year things have also gone a bit quiet.
For this reason I decided to move back to pelican. This was not as trivial as it maybe could have been. Getting evernote posts into markdown
with the images where I wanted wasn't simple. However, pelican comes with pelican-import which can import posts from a rss feed into markdown.
Postachio only puts the last 50 posts into the rss feed so I had to do an import, move posts into a different notebook, do an import etc...</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Once I had that done I had to grab the images and put them in the right place. Luckily all of the posts in the rss appeared to have my images
hosted on a postachio cdn. Using a simple regex I was able to write a script to locate image tags in the markdown files and then download the images
from the urls. As a part of this the script also had to update the image url to be the new, correct, relative url. I also had to tweak pelican-import to
look for published date rather than updated date in the feed.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Great, loads of markdown files and images. Next job, alter my old theme and then setup github pages. It's still far from being right but it's a start that'll do for now, I also need
to create an automation process so that I don't have to manually publish, I'm not sure how I'll do that yet. It'd be easy if it wasn't for the images.</p>
<p><br /></p>
<p>Anyway, new (kinda) site, woo! I also haven't forgotten photo a day. I'm still taking the photos but I want to work out my posting workflow before posting more
as the images are a pain. Hopefully I'll get that nailed soon.</p>
