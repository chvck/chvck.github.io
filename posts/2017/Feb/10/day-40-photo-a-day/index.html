      <p>Elysia and I went out for food tonight, we'd both wanted to go to
<a href="https://pysgoty.co.uk/home/">Pystgoty fish restaurant</a> for a while so
we finally got round to booking and went. I knew that the place was
small but it really is tiny! Four two person tables in a row is the lot.
Although the tables are all in a row and the place is small you do still
feel like you have your own space and some privacy. The toilet is also
actually a completely different building - they use the public toilets a
couple of buildings down! The food was fantastic, on the steep side
price wise but worth it. I had fish soup and hake bake and those were
both tasty, I probably could have just eaten the fish soup all night it
was amazing. Anyway, here's a hake bake.</p>
