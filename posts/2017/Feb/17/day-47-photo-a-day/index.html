This morning I was sat in work looking out wishing I was riding my bike,
the weather was great. I decided that I was going out after work for
sure, I've not ridden much lately and the feeling that I need to is
returning. By lunch I was a bit less enthusiastic and when I knocked off
at 4 it was starting to rain. I decided that was going out for some form
of ride regardless, even if only for an hour. I could do a road ride on
the ebike. I got home and changed and decided that I couldn't be
bothered fitted battery etc... so went out on my roadrat for an hour and
a half. It rained a bit, I got a bit wet, but it felt good to be out and
I got in 1.5 hours. It ws only a short ride, and quite slow. My cardio
fitness feels fine really but that might be because my legs won't let me
push myself much. Hills were no problem though, just a bit slow!
