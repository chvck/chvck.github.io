My most recent bike purchase. I'm trying to get as many tools etc... on
the bike as I can so that I can do most rides without a bag. I have the
innertube taped on, a bottle for water, Specialized SWAT multitool
mounted on the bottle cage so there isn't a load more that I need. So
what's this tool? It's a chainsplitter that replaces the headset top
cap, it's pretty nifty and it also holds a quick link. All that I have
left is mounting my pump to the bike (I appear to have lost the little
attachment that came with the pump to do this) and I think that I have
everything I need for a trailside repair.
