This one isn't a happy fun time photo but part of the point of this was
as a partial ongoing log. It's an incontinence bed protector pad thing.
I've mostly got bed wetting under control but now and then it happens.
It's happened twice in last week (first time this year) and one of those
times I really can't account for why. The advantage of this thing is
that I can also take it with me when I stay away from home and not have
to sleep on top of a quite narrow bivvy bag as a safeguard. I'll still
have to sleep in my sleeping bag to avoid soiling (is that the right
word for urine?) the bedsheets but it's something.

<p>Edit: well that's now 3 times this week, time to monitor drink intake
and be more regimented. No caffeine in the afternoon and no drinks after
8...</p>
