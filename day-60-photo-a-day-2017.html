	</div>

      <p>Today was really nice weather so I decided that I was going to finish at 4 and ride up to nant. I knocked off at 4 and it started raining, typical. I decided that I was going regardless and I had a really fun ride, fun until I hit the road home anyway. I PR'd a couple of descents and wasn't far off my PRs on a lot of others, I also had a play in the skills area to see how the ebike was to ride there. It was fine, I did a couple of laps of the middle jumps and a couple of laps of the pump track and it felt good on both. That means trouble for the mega! The reason the road home wasn't much fun was because by that point my hands and feet were freezing. 
<br>
<br>
It was too cold/wet to stop for a photo so instead here's a screengrab from the specialized app. The charts tab has loads more information about things such as my power output during the ride, the bikes power output during the ride, speed, elevation etc... As can be seen I used a decent whack of my 460Wh the battery gives me but I was in turbo (50%) mode for the entire ride so no surprise there.</p>
