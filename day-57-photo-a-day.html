	</div>

      <p>It's been properly windy today and even though I got ready to go riding I decided to not ride. Instead, I've been working on post automation
and did a spot of gardening. My vegetable garden was somewhat overgrown, it's still not quite ready. When I had the windows replaced I had to
remove a bush/shrub and I put the clippings into the compost, they're a bit woody so haven't composted. That was job number one, fish all of
that out of the heap. Job 2 was tame the brambles, which was easy enough to do with the help of some gloves. Job 3 was clearing, the lawn was
having a good go at reclaiming the veg patch for itself so I had to pull up all of the grass and also needed to clear out a load of wood and leaves.
I need to wait until it's dry before I can do the weeding as the soil clumps together so I can't fork it over and pull out the weeds just yet. </p>
