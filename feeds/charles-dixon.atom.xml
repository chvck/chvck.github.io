it to the bottom. My chain started skipping and then fell off so about half way down I
decided to pull over and put it back on. At that point I noticed that the chainring had snapped.
I thought about continuing but decided that I'd probably not make it up the leg burner so walked
back up Zorro. Down to no bikes!&lt;/p&gt;

his GPS took him the wrong way a bit so he got the train from the Newtown. I picked him
up from town ~8pm. I forgot to photo him. I ordered a refurbished Dyson V6 as it's
cordless and really light so should be a lot easier to use and that was delivered today.&lt;/p&gt;

In other news over the past few days my toothache has been getting increasingly worse.
Last night I lost quite a lot of sleep and have been in agony so I got
an emergency appointment at my dentist this afternoon at 2pm. He removed
the temporary filling and said that I have an abssess below the tooth, he's
left the tooth open to allow the abssess to drain. Feels better already.&lt;/p&gt;

got back to it this evening. I decided to park at the top of Zorro this time, as it's
a quicker and easier drive. It's also been raining a fair bit so I knew that the moorlands
would be wet and so I wanted to do that last. I felt pretty fast down Zorro, this bike is much easier to
move around than the Levo is. I think that I went a bit too fast up the leg
burner to begin with as my legs were suffering a little bit by Hippity Hop.
Coupled with riding yesterday and the wind and the resulting time reflected
it all. Just under 54 minutes which is 5 minutes slower than 2 weeks ago. 5 minutes is
quite a lot!&lt;/p&gt;

test out gear. We did a rideout to Nant this afternoon, them on their fully rigid touring bikes.

it seems that they're on holiday. Instead we wound up eating at Scholars. I had pasta with a spicy
tomato sauce and it was really nice. One to try again. &lt;/p&gt;

We didn't want to do something generic so we decided that running out of power could be a metaphor for life getting harder or something like that. We had an idea where you play the day to day life of someone with MS, starting healthy and then ending up in a different state - varying from healthy to not very healthy. I was struggling to work out how to make this into a game, and also how to respect MS and not accidentally make it seem trivial in some way. Defold editor also kept maxing out my RAM at random! In the end I gave up and played Borderlands 2 for the rest of the day! &lt;/p&gt;

during the night so need a mouthguard and I also need the tooth that hurts sorting. The
tooth probably needs root canal, but there is a chance that I won't. The plan estimate
was something of a shock to me! I've paid £65 so far and still have toothache!&lt;/p&gt;

Today I finally got round to starting to bring it back to life and, hopefully, build a top

work out how to route around that.&lt;/p&gt;

That somehow changed very rapidly into a bit of a bigger ride than I had planned and
using eco mode on the bike. In the end I rode up to Angler's Retreat via Zorro.
I very, very nearly managed the Nant-y-cagal climb but a balance mistake saw me nearly go
back down the step bit over the bars instead. It was really great to ride Hockey Mask again,
it's awesome. I also regained a load of my confidence for some reason. All in all, a really
great ride!&lt;/p&gt;

Anyway, MRI scan was OK. It was way shorter than normal as they only did a brain scan with contrast rather
than neck/spine too.

I had thrown my bike in the car just in case I wanted to ride afterward. It was a nice day,
I was in the mood and I sure didn't want to take the same route home so I decided to ride.
Brechfa is almost on the way home on the different route so that's where I want. I rode the

They arrived today. I setup the link and gave it a while with Super Meat Boy, a game where larency would matter.
No issues what-so-ever, pretty impressed. The controller is also mad, the buttons are also
customisable and there's even paddles that work as modifiers to make the buttons perform

I also went to a farm near Llanon with Elysia so that she could learn how to use a spinning wheel, she's was also lent one to learn on so you can probably guess what one photo this week will be... Anyway, the piano took me quite a long time and by the end gone was the idea of doing things sympathetically, for a start some things were glued in place. I had the chisel, hammer and wire cutters out by the end. Getting the harp out took a while, there was 1 bolt in the bottom left that wouldn't budge and I couldn't get the harp to move - something else was holding it in place. After a good while of trying to work out where the last bolt was I realised that the string pegs weren't attached to the harp, they were part of the backboard. Snip, snip, snip and the harp was moving. I used the weight of the harp to rip out the bottom left bolt and that was that. It took 2 of us to move the harp outside but it wasn't as heavy as I'd expected and from there moving the piano body was easy!&lt;/p&gt;

I think that next time I'll get down the top of Truman clean so long as I don't make any mistakes. I'd also seen a trail on Strava that I'd not ridden so I checked that out. It was rooty and not rocky! It was great! I had to clear a bit of it with the saw but that was fine. I also rode the trail that I found last week but with a bit of pace and that was also brilliant. I rode the new trail a couple of times and I also worked out how to get back onto Brashy Dive which was cool. Very happy now that I know a mix of rock and dirt trails up there.&lt;/p&gt;

I'm being sympathetic in my dismantling effort so that maybe I can convince someone that they want the body for a prop or something. So far it's been surprising modular in taking it apart, just needed to undo a few screws. Been quite interesting seeing how it all fits together and works too.&lt;/p&gt;

Balance was off and not feeling it. At the bottom I was feeling quite dehydrated though so I drank all of my water which meant that I needed to refill from the stream. I realised that I'd never actually been down to the stream and looked down the tunnel, so that is what I did. By the top of the leg burner I was feeling much better and had a great ride for the remainder!

&lt;br /&gt;

I'm very happy with it, it's definitely a good size and the height range is good. Construction was easy enough too. If I had to find any complaints then it scratches quite easily and shows up marks. My mouse also won't track on the surface!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
When I got home I decided to make a thai red curry. The reason why I haven't for a good while is that it requires coconut milk. I decided sod it, how much saturated fat can coconut milk have in it? Well, boy was I surprised. Even the reduced fat version had 60g of saturated fat per can. I was committed to the idea so I did it anyway but I'm going to be looking into alternatives...&lt;/p&gt;

It was going great, toboggan was riding great and the weather was nice. I decided to head out the top of nant on the Syfydin route. As I climbed up to the Bont Goch descent I was trying to choose between it and the bridleway. In the end I decided to take the Bont Goch descent, might have been a mistake! There was immediately a fair bit of water erosion and picking a good line was difficult. After I rounded the first left hander and was approaching warp speed I spotted a really big hole, too late. I slammed on the brakes but no way was I near to stopping, straight into the hole and very, very, luckily just about out the other side. I wound up running whilst still straddling the bike and I totally bottomed out my forks. Feel quite lucky I got away with it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
About 3/4 of the way down the descent I hucked off some rocks and just after I landed I felt the rear wheel buck out as I hit a big rock. Very soon after I realised I had a total flat. Annoying. Oh well, fit a new tube. Won't go up properly. Has a hole in it. I carry puncture repair stuff so I tried to repair it but no luck. Wound up riding the whole way home on a flat, think I might need a new tyre now :(&lt;/p&gt;

They're looking a bit sad in the photo but I've since given them a good glug of water each and they're looking happy again now. The weather here has been terrible lately so I think that I'll put them in the airing cupboard overnight to keep the compost warm. There's already a couple of chillies starting to grow on the Twilight too :).&lt;/p&gt;

Her mum cooked us some chinese bits, they had belly pork and I had poached fish, there was also black bean chicken which i tried a piece of. It was really nice and I need to learn how to make both of them! Sadly, after lunch we had to come home - it took us 5.5 hours which was actually pretty OK considering the distance.&lt;/p&gt;

I've not been sleeping right for a while now. My jawbone is telling me my deep sleep amount is well down, the majority of nights under 30 minutes. Whilst I take the figure itself with a pinch of salt I feel reasonably confident in believing the relative amounts over the months. It's now way down compared to what I was getting in March. It's hit the point where it is impacting on my well-being as I feel too tired in the evenings to do anything. I've decided I've got to do something about it, including throwing a bit of money at it. I don't want to go down the drugs route though. I've spent a bit of money on a blackout blind which should come next week and I'm trying to cut out screen time after 10 and then stretch/read until 11 when I'll go to sleep and then get up at 7. Bit of strictish routine should help I think. Until the black blind comes I have a makeshift solution... I got over double the amount of deep sleep as usual night but 1 night isn't a large enough sample size.&lt;/p&gt;

They've grown considerably since I last checked them. I had to do a spot of weeding as there were a couple of dandelions sprouting up. In hindsight I maybe should left them and just ate them too but I was a bit worried they'd steal resources from the other plants. I was in a bit of a productive mood so I also went to the garden centre to pick up some more top soil, and I bought a bell pepper plant whilst I was there - because why not. I want to get some chilli plants as I seem to be incapable of growing from seed but they don't sell those.

Using the top soil I finally finished filling in the holes in the lawn and also sowed some grass seed. So today's photo is the lawn as it stands at the moment, I'm hoping in a couple of months time to have an after shot with grass growing!&lt;/p&gt;

I don't use medjool dates because I'm not made of money so it takes a bit longer
as I have to pit the dates that I use. Snack food is one of the harder bits of
the oms diet, fruit is all well and good but sometimes I want something a bit different.
Having these in the fridge means that I don't have a fail and buy a bag of twiglets
or haribo.&lt;/p&gt;

was correct! I'd planned to do a "sea to summit to sea" ride, something
that's been on my radar since Dave and Pete rode it last year's solstice. The
summit being &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plynlimon"&gt;Pumlumon&lt;/a&gt;, the nearest mountain to aber.
I had my garmin loaded up with the route and set out at about 9am as a) I had
a family bbq I wanted to attend in the evening and b) it's aber cycle fest weekend
so some of the roads were closed later in the day.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The route I rode up to nant
was actually a new one on me. From there it was Joe's back garden to the bottom climb up to 
the summit. THe climb was going well until the fireroad just ended. Dave had mentioned a hike a bike
but I had hoped that I'd be OK on ebike. No, it really was hike a bike. I pushed through reasonably
thick trees for a bit until deciding that enough was enough and it was time to turn back. I found a stream
and started following that briefly which bought me out into a bit of a cleared section. It was where I
was meant to be, it was where the track on the map was. There was no track, just grassy, tussocky bog for
the most part but it was clear and it was pushable. After a while I came across the footpath up Pumlumon,
it was fireroad. I was happy. My legs were somewhat not.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I stuck the bike in turbo as there was plenty of battery power left and my legs
were struggling after the hike a bike. The fireroad ran out after a bit and the route became grass,
but rideable, to the summit. A new view for me! The route back down was basically a steepish field
with lots of tussocks. A bit boring to be honest. It dropped me back down at Nant-y-moch.
I made it home in time to drive to Oswestry and partake in the BBQ which was also cool!&lt;/p&gt;

appointment with my neurologist. Parking was, as usual, awful. There were cars everywhere,
luckily we managed to pull into a not a space really quickly. We arrived a bit early as I wanted
to leave a bit of buffer time as it's a 1hr45 drive but I was seen at pretty much bang on
11:30 and was done by 11:45! We discussed my meds and my lymphocyte count. If my lymphocyte
count gets too low then they'll pull me off the meds as the, very rare, occurences of
PML have occured with low lymphocyte counts. Mine was surprisingly high, the count was normal.
That's good! 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I also asked him about the OMS diet. He had heard of it. He said that it can't hurt and
that they're OK with it. It's a good idea to cut down on saturated fat and replace it
with poly-unsaturated, for anybody. He also said it may help but because it's healthy
rather than some magic bullet combination of foods. He said as a general rule, don't cut out
any food groups. My takeaway from it was that I'll keep following the diet but not treat it as gospel.
I may, quite rarely, eat some white meat/game. I'm going to keep off dairy but I'm
going to sometimes eat cake and things like that (I'm aware they have dairy in), not often but sometimes.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After chatting for a bit we moved onto tests. I think that he said that my reflexes
are brisk. My hip flexors are definitely weakened and my legs are over-toned which
causes them to be stiff. I must find hip flexor exercises to try build up whatever
muscles are still good to try to compensate I think.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; 
After the hospital visit we went to see George and Poppy and their new addition to the family, Finn.
It was really nice to see them and catch up and to also meet Finn. Finn would have
made for a much better photo too! Next time we'll make the visit a bit
longer.&lt;/p&gt;

about ready to sell my bike. It's difficult to explain how my legs feel but it's not good
and it's frustrating. I just can't ride fast and it has a knock on effect into
the descents too as I can't pedal out of the saddle when they're at all tired.
Should get the ebike back mid week and I'm really looking forward to that. I'm
still going to ride the mega, it's a fun bike. I think I'll probably keep rides
on it below 20km though.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was in no mood for taking photos so here's my tea instead. I followed 
&lt;a href="https://goodfood.uktv.co.uk/recipe/mussels-with-garlic-chilli-and-tomato/"&gt;this recipe&lt;/a&gt; and
had chilli, garlic and tomato mussels with some homemade 50% wholemeal buns, salad
and chips. It was actually rather a lot of food!&lt;/p&gt;

We quickly realised that actually the appointment I had should have been 3 months previous but
due to some administrative error it'd been missed. Explains why I had an appointment today
and I have one in Swansea on Monday. Bonus is that I had bloods taken today (with no wait at
all) so hopefully won't need them taken on Monday. Last time I had bloods taken in Swansea
there was a 2 hour wait, so I'm quite happy that I should be able to avoid that!&lt;/p&gt;

thought would be a short bit of overgrown, old track. It wasn't, it's a pretty
full on downhill track! I pushed up it quite a way but then it got too steep.
I still need to find the top! On the way back down I was having a fun but scary time.
Then, bang! I was down. I wasn't entirely sure what happened but I fell off at the
bottom of a chute into a corner. On the push up I spotted a stump in the chute
that I thought was perfect for grabbing a pedal. Turns out, it was! A few cuts and
bruises but all good.

got around 10 hours of sleep! I cleaned up and photo'd some bike bits that I want
to sell. Just as I finished doing that Elysia rang me and asked if I wanted
to go for lunch with her. Yes, yes I did. We went to Baravin, I was disappointed
to see that my favourite had been taken off the menu but the soup of the day
was carrot and coriander with sourdough bread. So I went for that and it was very nice,
I also had a cold brew coffee - I always forget how nice that is. In the afternoon
I spent most of the time doing gamebuildr but as the evening approached I decided
that I wanted to ride my bike. I really couldn't get enthused about riding nant.
I remembered that the Ystwyth ride just gone went somewhere that I'd not ridden before,
starting from tre-ddol which is a short drive away. I loaded the route onto my garmin
in the hope that the battery would last the ride and set out. Sorted!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got there to find my rear flat completely flat and the garmin refusing to load
the route. I shoved some air in the tyre and had a bit of a fiddle and it seemed to
be holding air and I set out in the hope that the garmin would sort itself out.
I was straight onto a dirt trail, dirt - yes! I was really hoping for dirt trails
rather than rocky ones. Halfway up the first (singletrack!) climb my garmin
started working. Things were looking up! The loop was really fun, the descents were
great and mostly techy. There were some fantastic views over the estuary from
on the top. A route that I'll be doing again for sure and I might try to
find some more stuff over there too. My legs now have that after exercise glowing
feeling, I can't remember the last time I felt this. They usually just have a
deep, dull ache!&lt;/p&gt;

has become a bit of a storage room. I mostly just moved stuff that belongs
outside into the garage and then tidied up to leave some space and make
the room a room again. My reasoning for doing this is to give me some clear space
for doing stretches and a small amount of weight stuffs. I also wrote down
all of my stretches as I have a habit of forgetting a couple of them and this
way I can see them all and just follow the order.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I try to hold each stretch for 15 seconds but I felt like the routine
was taking far longer than it should have been. As I just judge how long to
hold them based on doing 15 slow breaths I decided to actually time a couple
of the stretches. Turns out I hold each for 30-45 seconds, no bad thing I
think!&lt;/p&gt;

The difference this year was that there were 2 routes, the enduro and the bach. The enduro was 55km and the bach 40km, they were similar routes but the bach just cut a few bits out. Looking at the map of the routes we'd kind of decided to do the enduro but cut out 1 section which has nothing much fun in it. We'd also spotted a slight shortcut that I could take to cut out the single track climb as I was a bit concerned I'd end up walking it and my legs would give up on life.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We arrived ~9:30, signed on, got ready and tried to find Taylor. We were at the back of the queue and a brief phone call told us that he was at the front. We wound up starting roughly mid pack with a view to catch him up if he took it steady. We started off and as we were riding along the road I was feeling pretty good but very shortly after we hit the first fireroad I could feel that my legs weren't going to be good. I was riding slowly and I couldn't go any faster. My legs weren't shaking or anything they were just saying no. I felt like I was moving in slow motion for most of the climbs. It was almost like a disconnect between brain and legs, my brain would say push harder/faster and my legs would say yes but then they just wouldn't.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The others waited for me at the top of the climbs and part way up them too which was nice as it meant I wasn't always alone on them thinking about how bad my legs were being. On each climb I decided that I was packing it in at the top. At the top of each climb I decided that there was no way I wasn't riding the descent. At the bottom of the descents adrenaline would be pumping and I'd be feeling good again! A vicious cycle.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of the descents were great fun and I managed to stay stood up on them. I rode my own ride on a few of them, on elephant Bean and I decided to cut off and do the alternative line as the main trail was a big queue. Sadly I decided to skip world cup. The climb from world cup to the feed station is long and I just didn't feel like it was going to be a good idea. I'd just gone over the bars onto bedrock on Caban Coch too so my upper body was hurting in addition to my legs. I skipped a section after the feed station which has a quite long descent and a bit of climbing and I also skipped goshawk as that had the single track climb up to it, luckily the descent before has a sneak shortcut out of it to the bottom of goshawk. As such I'd left the others behind so I decided to just crack on up to 3in1. On the climb couple of riders who were pushing their bikes managed to catch up with me whilst I was actually riding, "sorry mate, we slowed down a bit because we didn't want to demotivate you but...". Had to laugh! I rode the single track just off of 3in1 which was great, grabbed my beer at the bottom and waited for the others before crossing the finish line and spinning back down to Mach. It didn't even rain for the whole ride!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Bean n Steph asked me to take a photo of them at the finish line in Mach and I was taking the photo who appeared from the crowd behind them? It was Taylor! He'd not hung around on the ride and had put in a good time and then just waited for us to finish. It was good to see him and look at his new bike too.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was a good day out, I didn't enjoy some of it and I really enjoyed some other bits of it. I'm disappointed that I didn't get to ride world cup but I think it was for the best. Unless things change dramatically for the better then this will probably be my last dyfi on a non-ebike so I'm really glad that I did it and got the mug. I'm also grateful that the others waited for me as I really was on a go-slow. We finished off the day by eating slow cooked chilli, drinking beer and watching the DH world cup. Things could certainly be far, far worse!&lt;/p&gt;

has come to be quite loose. Cables have to be wiggled around to get them to engage
and the slightest knock knocks them out. Not great, really annoying when using the
phone as a satnav and charging at the same time. Anyway, I was looking at phones
when I realised that my phone is covered by 2 year EU warranty. Sorted! I emailed
Amazon to say that I'd like a repair on warranty. They replied with no repair,
no replacement but they'd give me a full refund if I returned it. Er, deal!
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Because I'd now have the money from that phone I decided to spend a little more
money than I would have otherwise. I spent a good while looking at phones and
they all seemed to have something wrong with them. The obvious choice was the
Oneplusthree but it was a bit big and a bit more money than I wanted to spend.
I came upon the Xiaomi Mi5, which seemed to tick all my boxes. It is not easy to get hold
of in the UK, it's popular in China and India. I found one Uk seller, on ebay - I wanted
a UK seller so I'd have warranty.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it came I tried to update it and quite quickly came to discover that it
had an unofficial rom on it. One that's a bit dodgy and possibly had malware.
Putting a new rom on was pretty simple but a bit of a faff. To begin with the
bootloader must be unlocked but to do that you need the miui guys to unlock it via
your mi account. It's just a form to fill in and they actually granted me access overnight.
Next issue, no Windows on any of my machines. Luckily, Elysia has a Windows install on
her mac. That ran out of space. In the end I grabbed a windows 7 VM, unlocked the phone,
flashed miui 8 (android 7) onto it and relocked it. It needs locking for things
like android pay to work. Miui has some neat features like one handed mode and
I'm very happy with it now I have it set up with nova launcher and a few things
set to how I want.  &lt;/p&gt;

I had moroccan spiced rice, vegetable and nut bake. It was really nice and the

I also did some more work on our Ludum Dare game and it's pretty fun now :)&lt;/p&gt;

Early this morning the theme was released - "A Small World", not a great theme
IMO but that's what was voted for. After some discussion we decided to make a game
where you play as pluto battling to regain the title of being a planet. Initially
we set it up to be like pong but we pulled the camera out a bit to enable 360 degree
paddle movement. The idea is to just destroy the other planets by making the ball hit the planets,
the asteroids provide extra gravity effects on the ball to things interesting. You can play
the game at &lt;a href="http://dirty-casuals.co.uk/LD38-A-Small-World/"&gt;LD38-A-Small_world&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

have tiny specks of paint on them too. Following that I edged the rear lawn and did some more

went to the garden centre with Elysia to pick up some top soil and compost, and
also had a coffee there. I started filling in the big holes in my lawn with said top soil,
I'm going to need more. I'm also going to need to remember to buy grass seed. I hoed
the veggie patch and a couple of the smaller little bits in the patio and mixed
some compost into them. I planted some mint, basil and holy basil, hopefully they'll
grow! I slow cooked a chili and rearranged some of the kitchen. 
I also did some gamebuildr and had a gamebuildr meeting. Not such a relaxing day after
all!&lt;/p&gt;

the ebike again. I knew where I want to go, just not how I wanted to get there
or back. I set off out toward Capel Dewi and the bike seemed to be behaving,
I decided that I was going to head to the top of nant via Zorro. Once at the top of
Nant I had a few options on which way to go but I decided to just follow the Syfydrin
trail out to Nant-y-moch and then keep following the road to Nant y cagal. At that point
I decided to try ride up the steep techy climb as a) it's shorter than the road round and
b) I was on an ebike. I also managed it, but not quite. From there I just followed my usual
way out to the Mach 3 loop and The Chute. It was a nice clear day and the views were good.
I even got treated to a close up of a kite. The chute was, as always, really fun. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was a bit torn about which way to head home, I'm not a big fan
of Scaletrix but I knew that following the Mach 3 and then heading back the way
I came would involve lifting over more gates than I wanted. I'd already had to
lift over quite a few. I devised a plan to head to Hyddgen sheds but to keep
going down the side of Nant-y-moch rather than go along Scaletrix. After that I
decided to ride the field section of Joe's Back Garden backward, something that I'd
never done before. Something that I'm in no rush to do again. It wasn't bad or anything,
it just wasn't especially exciting either. Ice rink, toboggan and home. Ebike decided
to stop working on the final climb up to my house which wasn't great but manageable.
All in managed to do 75km, a nice day out! &lt;/p&gt;

to test my legs. I also fitted a dinner plate cassette (11-42) yesterday so wanted to try it.
I set out and got up the mountain road feeling pretty good and was even getting up ice rink just fine,
I managed the difficult corner no worries. Just after that corner though, disaster struck. I pedalled
and there was a very fast clicking noise and no movement. "That sounds like the freehub slipping" I thought.
Tried to pedal again, same thing. Yup, the freehub was not engaging under any load at all. Great.
I was 12km from home so it took me 2 hours to walk/scoot it. I dropped my saddle right down and removed
the pedals so that I could scoot along on the flat fireroads/backroads. It's
not much fun walking on roads with neither pavement or verge. It reminded me just
how much rubbish there is on roadsides - especially busy roads but quiet roads too,
it's quite depressing really.&lt;/p&gt;

assisting me on half of the crank rotation but cutting out for the other half. I knew
that something wasn't right at this point and pulled over to check the specialized app.
Yup, 2 errors showing on the motor. Damn. Shortly after the motor cut out completely.
I played about turning the battery on and off a few times and got the motor working
a bit so cut the ride short. On getting home the app was reporting all OK. Sods law.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Summit cycles handled my warranty claim on the battery so when I got home I popped back in.
I needed a new chain and a couple of gear cables anyway. I wasn't sure it was going to be worth trying
for another warranty claim with an intermittent issue but I had a chat with them anyway. 
Apparently they now have all of the tools to perform diagnostics there so I'm going to
drop my bike in on Tuesday and hopefully they can find something. I have screenshots
of the app reporting errors on my phone too.&lt;/p&gt;

and my resting heart rate for the last 7 days against length of sleep each day.
&lt;br /&gt;
My target sleep is 7hr30, not for any specific reason other than it sounds reasonable.
So I managed to hit 102% of that target, I started to go to sleep at 23:23 and I woke
up properly at 07:41. The rest is quite self explanatory, those 2 wake ups were
both to go to the toilet.&lt;/p&gt;

The weather was really nice (I actually sunburnt) and I fancied toboggan and the secret descent.
I spent a while trying to get round the bottom corner on toboggan and I finally managed it!
I don't think it's going to be something I'm consistent at but at least I know I can do it. As
an added bonus I also found my lost glove just sat on the outside of one of the corners.
The mega is definitely easier to control on steep stuff. I rode the usual top of nant to the visitor
centre where I had a coffee and bumped into someone from work so had a chat too. Secret descent was
riding amazingly grippy and fast so I decided to also go a different way home. A bridleway along the rheidol valley
that I'd only ridden once before. I now remember why... It'd probably be quite nice if sections weren't churned up
by horses to the point of being unrideable but it was a bit of an adventure anyway and something a bit different.
&lt;br /&gt;
Trying to decide on an image has been tricky as I took quite a few but I quite like the colours in this one and it's unlikely to be something I see again anytime soon.&lt;/p&gt;

I wasn't, I realised that when I came to this river crossing, not a shallow river.
I backtracked and just rode the road up the valley side, which is rather steep!&lt;/p&gt;

the worst but hopefully I've made the job easier for future me. Paul and I went riding in the afternoon
aiming to ride out to the chute but time was getting on a bit by the time we got to Angler's Retreat so
we decided to ride the figure of 8 loop. I had the cunning idea of showing Paul the extraction track,
turns out that loggers have been round those parts and the flat was an absolute mess of deep, deep mud.
So that was hard going. I also had the cunning idea that we could try the hairdressers descents on the return.
Well, that was also deep, deep mud. Hard going. We got home just before sunset so probably good that we didn't
head to the chute.&lt;/p&gt;

I was in work for 8 on the dot. I was meant to go with her but at time of booking flights
I was struggling with my bladder and hadn't yet worked out how to manage it very well. This
made me somewhat reluctant to spend hours on a train and then 2 weeks in a foreign country
where they speak a different language. She's also gone with another friend anyway so she's not alone.
I'm hoping to go next time for sure though.&lt;/p&gt;

of Gamebuildr and made some good progress on a few issues. By lunch time I wanted to get out of the
house so I went to Charlie's stores to buy some herb seeds. Whilst I was there I also picked up some more bird
seed, hopefully I'll get some birds on the feeders soon. I got basil, thai basil, coriander (cilantro), mint, oregano mixed salad leaves and some
scotch bonnets for good measure.&lt;/p&gt;

in the car park I turned on my bike to find that it hadn't been charged - the plug

and I endeavoured to ride a 20kg bike. I really didn't expect my legs to be in a good state by the top of the
first climb. They were fine for almost all of the ride though! This really, really surprised me and I'm not sure
why they held up so well. My general fitness also seems to be pretty decent, I wasn't blowing up on any of the climbs
and wasn't going really slow either. We managed around 17 miles with 1000 metres of elevation so not exactly an easy ride either.
&lt;br&gt;

What I didn't do was take a photo, d'oh! So, here's one of yesterday evening's handywork!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="http://www.charliesdirect.co.uk/"&gt;Charlies stores&lt;/a&gt; to buy a lawn aerator. My rear lawn is basically
becoming a bog and moss is slowly taking over from grass. A friend suggested aerating it, the tool
is only a tenner so I figured it was worth a go. Unfortunately the problem with places like Charlies is
that it's impossible to go in and only come out with what you went in for. So I now also have a new bow
saw and a pair of gardening gloves (my old ones were full of holes, not great for pulling brambles). Still, less
than 15 quid spent so not too bad!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The lawn is now full of holes so hopefully that'll help. I also removed another little shrub and started work on the trees.
I've taken one down by chopping off all of the fronds individually so I can actually dispose of them, I still need to cut out more
of the trunk. That'll be tough going. Certainly already looks better in my opinion.&lt;/p&gt;

them down quite low on the trunk. In place of all of these things I'm going to plant various herbs, I want the trees
gone to try open things up a bit as they're a bit commandeering. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
So this evening I started by removing the biggest of the shrubs which took me a good couple of hours

I left work at 3 due to it being sunny and low wind. I figured that these days don't come often at the moment so got to go for it! I had a great ride -felt really quick on the descents which strava seems to agree with, a few PRs there. The weather stayed nice and I didn't really need lights either, I just turned on my little "be seen" ones. I also managed to get the bike battery down to 7% which is the first time that I've got it below 10%. It seems to beep a lot and cut the motor out to remind you that you're running low on power which is pretty exciting going uphill!&lt;/p&gt;

We met in Brynamlwg which is the only pub at the top of the hill, it used to be members only but is now open to all. It's a nice enough place, feels like a proper pub and the staff are friendly. The beer prices are slightly less friendly at £3.50 a bottle but I guess being the only pub up here they can do that. The only other bars are the union and the art centre, the union has sticky floors and is, obviously, very studenty. I don't imagine the art centre being any cheaper.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
We're going to try adopt a kanban meets scrum approach, something akin to scumban but maybe a bit less formal and scrum-esque. There's no review with stakeholders, because there are none, but we will do planning and retrospective albeit in the same meeting. Scrums are a no-go, we work independent ad-hoc hours and they're probably just not necessary for us as we have a really good line of communication and discuss everything anyway. I guess that we are loosely following scrum but we've cut it back a bit to suit our needs.&lt;/p&gt;

My slippers and chain lube that I left at Ed's party but also a bread machine that Ben's family have kindly given to me. Tonight I decided to give it a go, I don't really want loaves of bread most of the time though. What I want most of the time are flatbreads and, sometimes, baps. Luckily, the machine will do dough, including raising time etc... So I decided to try make some focaccia. The machine did the hard work and I just had to shove ingredients in the pan and leave it until ready. Once ready I just put the dough in a pan and stretched it to fit using my hands, then baked. I think I left it slightly too long because the outside has gone slightly hard rather than it all being soft but the inside is nice, light and soft. It tastes a bit bland but that's down to the ingredients and this being a first time so plenty of space for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

I knocked off at 4 and it started raining, typical. I decided that I was going regardless and I had a really fun ride, fun until I hit the road home anyway. I PR'd a couple of descents and wasn't far off my PRs on a lot of others, I also had a play in the skills area to see how the ebike was to ride there. It was fine, I did a couple of laps of the middle jumps and a couple of laps of the pump track and it felt good on both. That means trouble for the mega! The reason the road home wasn't much fun was because by that point my hands and feet were freezing. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It was too cold/wet to stop for a photo so instead here's a screengrab from the specialized app. The charts tab has loads more information about things such as my power output during the ride, the bikes power output during the ride, speed, elevation etc... As can be seen I used a decent whack of my 460Wh the battery gives me but I was in turbo (50%) mode for the entire ride so no surprise there.&lt;/p&gt;

I just thought that I'd make a note in case it helps someone else or I forget... It seems to be when the battery has totally drained.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
The fix is pretty simple, take a look at your clock. For me this issue has always been that the clock has jumped ahead to the year 2154 which has somehow screwed up the wifi, could be messing up crypto stuff I guess? Anyway, setting the clock to manual and resetting back to today fixes it for me. Once the wifi reconnects I can set it back to sync the clock to a remote server. Seems a bit catch-22, the wifi can't connect because the date is totally invalid and the clock can't set itself because the wifi is down.  &lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="random"></category><category term="dev"></category></entry><entry><title>Adding thumbnails</title><link href="/posts/2017/Feb/28/adding-thumbnails/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-28T18:26:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-28T18:26:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Charles Dixon</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-02-28:/posts/2017/Feb/28/adding-thumbnails/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I sent a link to this blog to my mate and commented that  github pages were a bit slow to serve it.

He replied ""shouldn't be, github pages are usually pretty snappy", he then went on to say "however, you are linking to your full sized images on the index page". Ah, oops! Good point that... He sent me a link to a script that he'd used for generating thumbnails from existing images so I decided that I'd just hack on that and change it to my needs. Before doing that, I decided to have a bit of a Google for pelican thumbnails - it didn't seem to me that I'd be the first person to be doing this. I discovered &lt;a href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-plugins/tree/master/thumbnailer"&gt;pelican thumbnailer&lt;/a&gt; which looked ideal to me. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Armed with the thumbnailer I did some testing. Yup, it generated thumbnails from my images, great! The next step was linking to these images from my posts, I decided the simple way to do this was to add a new metadata field to my posts called "Thumbnail: " just containing the path to where the thumbnail should be once generated. Well, I wasn't going to do this manually was I? I wrote a little script to find the first image in my markdown (if any) and then take the path and add a new line as detailed above. Bit of testing and all looked good. As can be seen in my photo a day posts the links work and the index page is loading much faster, at time of testing: 7.7mb down to 232kb!&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="dev"></category></entry><entry><title>Day 57 - photo a day</title><link href="/posts/2017/Feb/27/day-57-photo-a-day-2017/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2017-02-27T00:00:00+00:00</updated><author><name>Charles Dixon</name></author><id>tag:None,2017-02-27:/posts/2017/Feb/27/day-57-photo-a-day-2017/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It's been properly windy today and even though I got ready to go riding I decided to not ride.

Instead, I've been working on post automation
and did a spot of gardening. My vegetable garden was somewhat overgrown, it's still not quite ready. When I had the windows replaced I had to
remove a bush/shrub and I put the clippings into the compost, they're a bit woody so haven't composted. That was job number one, fish all of
that out of the heap. Job 2 was tame the brambles, which was easy enough to do with the help of some gloves. Job 3 was clearing, the lawn was
having a good go at reclaiming the veg patch for itself so I had to pull up all of the grass and also needed to clear out a load of wood and leaves.
I need to wait until it's dry before I can do the weeding as the soil clumps together so I can't fork it over and pull out the weeds just yet. &lt;/p&gt;

Google wasn't quite giving me the answers that I wanted. What I wanted was a full end to end automation process, i.e. I write a post, it appears on my blog. I did a bit of thinking and decided there were 2 steps to this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Source content and pelican creation of output&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Publishing the output to github&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Starting at the beginning then, I have my output folder setup as its own github repo at &lt;a href="http://chvck.github.io"&gt;http://chvck.github.io&lt;/a&gt;, the rest of the blog setup and the theme will go into another repo which will have the content and output folders ignored (I'll explain why the content is ignored later). 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
To publish the output it seemed pretty obvious that I needed to have some sort of git auto commit folder watcher. There are a few git auto-commit hits on google so one of those plus a post-commit hook to push was my first idea. But, then I found &lt;a href="https://github.com/nevik/gitwatch"&gt;gitwatch&lt;/a&gt; which is a handy script that handles all of this for me. Worth noting, I have a ssh key stored with ssh-agent so I don't need to enter a password to push. OK cool, so now when my output folder is updated then it gets published. Rad!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Next step, and this one was tricker, was to work out how to automate the output generation. Well, pelican has a -r switch which means that it monitors the content directory for changes. OK cool, that's easy. Problem for me was that I didn't want my content directory to simply be a directory on my local filesystem, this would mean I could only post from my PC. I also wanted to be able to easily post from my mobile (and easily add images). Hey, google drive support is now kinda built into some linux distros. Cool! No, not so great. Whilst it is built in it's not great. For me it was really, really slow and it also doesn't do offline sync i.e. it won't update a local copy of something until you open it (well, containing folder). Hmm. 
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Then I found &lt;a href="https://www.thefanclub.co.za/overgrive"&gt;overgrive&lt;/a&gt; which claims to do what the official google drive apps do on windows/macos. For $4.99 I figured it was worth a go (turns out there's a free 14 day trial too, didn't know that though) and it's good. It's fast and it does offline sync... great! Next up I put all of my current content into a dir on google drive and then I symlinked that folder as my pelican content directory. Using the -r switch in pelican I now have automated generation. So that's generation and publishing sorted. Rad!
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Final piece of the puzzle is something that means that I can write posts directly on google drive (I use markdown which google drive doesn't support). Enter &lt;a href="https://stackedit.io"&gt;stackedit&lt;/a&gt;, a web app that I can use from any online device. It lets you write markdown (even gives a live preview of the processed markdown) and save it to google drive. So, with any luck, this post is going to be saved from stackedit and it'll appear on my blog. Here we go!
&lt;br&gt;

I can't have. Despite promises that they were going to improve things toward the end of last year things have also gone a bit quiet.
For this reason I decided to move back to pelican. This was not as trivial as it maybe could have been. Getting evernote posts into markdown
with the images where I wanted wasn't simple. However, pelican comes with pelican-import which can import posts from a rss feed into markdown.
Postachio only puts the last 50 posts into the rss feed so I had to do an import, move posts into a different notebook, do an import etc...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once I had that done I had to grab the images and put them in the right place. Luckily all of the posts in the rss appeared to have my images
hosted on a postachio cdn. Using a simple regex I was able to write a script to locate image tags in the markdown files and then download the images
from the urls. As a part of this the script also had to update the image url to be the new, correct, relative url. I also had to tweak pelican-import to
look for published date rather than updated date in the feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Great, loads of markdown files and images. Next job, alter my old theme and then setup github pages. It's still far from being right but it's a start that'll do for now, I also need

to jump doesn't result in gruesome death anyway. I also did a run of high as a kite which felt good on a much lighter bike than I usually ride!&lt;/p&gt;

It's an orange cocoa cake, no eggs or milk or anything. It tastes really

decent greaseproof paper though, I don't use what i have because things
stick to it... As such I baked directly in the tin and it seems that the

For a while now I've been looking at sleep trackers with an eye to try
improve my sleep by working out ideal sleep lengths etc... I've been
using sleep as android on my phone, which seems quite feature packed and
I love the smart wakeup feature but I'm dubious about the tracking
accuracy. I rarely sleep through the night and have to get up to go for
a wee a few times, sleep as android doesn't ever seem to detect this as
awake time. Understandable as the phone just lies on the bed so just
sees a flurry of movement then stillness, another flurry then still
again.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The very best trackers are upwards of 100 quid and even general fitness
bands that also do sleep tracking tend to be \~£80 and a lot of them
sleep tracking seems like a bit of an afterthought. The Jawbone UP3
appears on a few sleep tracker rundowns as one of the better bands for
it, although it has a closed API so won't integrate with other apps and
I think that it was recently bought out and the buyer said they won't be
releasing any further updates (could be something else though). It does
have smart wakeup and things like that though. Anyway, I found a seller
on ebay selling the UP3 for £40 new but without packaging. £40 is just
about the maximum that I've been willing to flutter on this as it's
almost about interest as anything else. Being able to track the number
of times I wake up during the night could prove useful though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today it arrived, it's reasonably small and seems pretty simple to use.
Three LEDs show various things such as mode and various notifications.
The app was pretty simple to setup and seems to have everything that I
need, it also does things like step tracking and monitors heart rate.
I'm not overly interested in step tracking, passive heart rate could be
interesting though. Whilst the band doesn't actively monitor heart rate
it does have what it calls passive monitoring. This means that it
samples heart rate at various points during the day, this is supposed to
assist with showing the effect of hydration, stress etc... on heart
rate. It also works out resting heart rate by sampling heart rate when
you wake up. I suspect once the novelty wears off I may stop wearing it
during the day, we'll see. One other thing I really like is that you
don't have to tell the app when you're going to sleep or wake up, it
just detects it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;EDIT: After 1 night sleep it does appears to work quite well. I took
note of the times I started to try to sleep and what time and I woke up
and the tracker was pretty accurate on times. It monitored deep sleep,
REM, light sleep and number of wake ups and time awake. 2h27m deep
sleep, 3h5m light sleep, 1h14m REM, 39m awake (this is including a
period of time where I just lay in bed and didn't really get up, it
appears to show this period on the chart as awake too which is quite
cool) and 2 wake ups. Obviously I have no idea how accurate the sleep
lengths are, but the awake feels like it's about right and the wake ups
is correct too. I've just noticed it tracks passive heart rate during
sleep too and displays a chart of overnight heart rate and RHR across
the week which is cool if you're a nerd for basically useless data like
I am!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This morning I was sat in work looking out wishing I was riding my bike,
the weather was great. I decided that I was going out after work for
sure, I've not ridden much lately and the feeling that I need to is
returning. By lunch I was a bit less enthusiastic and when I knocked off
at 4 it was starting to rain. I decided that was going out for some form
of ride regardless, even if only for an hour. I could do a road ride on
the ebike. I got home and changed and decided that I couldn't be
bothered fitted battery etc... so went out on my roadrat for an hour and
a half. It rained a bit, I got a bit wet, but it felt good to be out and
I got in 1.5 hours. It ws only a short ride, and quite slow. My cardio
fitness feels fine really but that might be because my legs won't let me
push myself much. Hills were no problem though, just a bit slow!

This one isn't a happy fun time photo but part of the point of this was
as a partial ongoing log. It's an incontinence bed protector pad thing.
I've mostly got bed wetting under control but now and then it happens.
It's happened twice in last week (first time this year) and one of those
times I really can't account for why. The advantage of this thing is
that I can also take it with me when I stay away from home and not have
to sleep on top of a quite narrow bivvy bag as a safeguard. I'll still
have to sleep in my sleeping bag to avoid soiling (is that the right
word for urine?) the bedsheets but it's something.

&lt;/div&gt;

My most recent bike purchase. I'm trying to get as many tools etc... on
the bike as I can so that I can do most rides without a bag. I have the
innertube taped on, a bottle for water, Specialized SWAT multitool
mounted on the bottle cage so there isn't a load more that I need. So
what's this tool? It's a chainsplitter that replaces the headset top
cap, it's pretty nifty and it also holds a quick link. All that I have
left is mounting my pump to the bike (I appear to have lost the little
attachment that came with the pump to do this) and I think that I have
everything I need for a trailside repair.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

small but it really is tiny! Four two person tables in a row is the lot.
Although the tables are all in a row and the place is small you do still
feel like you have your own space and some privacy. The toilet is also
actually a completely different building - they use the public toilets a
couple of buildings down! The food was fantastic, on the steep side
price wise but worth it. I had fish soup and hake bake and those were
both tasty, I probably could have just eaten the fish soup all night it
was amazing. Anyway, here's a hake bake.&lt;/p&gt;

that I can still flick through that one and find something else to do

day. I tend to just eat two (big) meals a day plus a bit of fruit as a
snack once or twice too. I don't really like having breakfast early (as
in before work) it makes my feel a bit unwell and I don't really have
time anyway as I'm pretty useless at getting out of bed. For this reason
I decided to make some breakfast bars that I can just grab one of and
eat whilst I'm putting together my flask of coffee. Trying to find a
recipe actually wasn't as easy as I expected, due to needing it to be
vegan and low fat. A lot of recipes seem to have coconut in them. In the
end I went for

although I replaced raisins with blueberries because ugh raisins. Due to
my oven being quite rubbish I think that they could have done with being
baked for a bit longer but that's something I know for next time.&lt;/p&gt;

nutty, and it doesn't coat your mouth in a film like some other oils

day! I started out in fedora 24 and kept getting the error
&lt;code&gt;LLVM triggered Diagnostic Handler: unsupported call to function exp10f in main&lt;/code&gt;,
I wound up formatting and installing ubuntu and STILL got it.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That did not please me.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the editor would run the create/open project screen it'd bomb
with that error in the logs when I tried to open or create a project.
Anyway, that's jumping the gun a little.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Googling this issue didn't throw up a whole lot but one of the, few,
hits hinted at graphics drivers. I have a radeon rx200 graphics card and
it seems that the AMD proprietary drivers have been dropped in both
fedora 24 and ubuntu 16.04+ (I'm using ubuntu-gnome 16.10). The open
source drivers seem to be good enough though, I've been playing Heroes
of the Storm through wine without issues. I spent a fair bit of time
poking around my system and googling various things, I somehow got into
looking at opengl. I saw that my system was using a version of mesa that
gave me opengl 3. I saw that UE4 had an opengl4 flag so decided that it
had to be worth a go as I was pretty sure the error was related to
graphics. In the end I tracked down the Oibaf PPA which offered up a
newer version of mesa and llvm. I thought that it looked promising and
then came across &lt;a href="https://www.epicgames.com/unrealtournament/forums/showthread.php?23665-How-to-update-Open-Source-graphic-driver-in-Ubuntu"&gt;this link on the epic games
forums&lt;/a&gt;
which validated it a bit so went for it. The step missing in that guide
that I needed was to do an &lt;code&gt;apt-get dist-upgrade&lt;/code&gt;. After doing that I
rebooted and started UE4 again, created a project and hey! there we go,
it works.
&lt;br /&gt;

 vitamin d test kit. Why? I'll tell you why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I bought the litmus paper because of a conversation I had with a
colleague at my works christmas meal. We were chatting and I mentioned
that I have MS, he asked me if I'd ever tested my pH level - I had not.
He went on to talk about body pH level and the importance of it and
suggested I got some and tested myself. I figured nothing to lose, may
as well take a look as it can't hurt to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The vitamin d test, well I could waffle about this for quite a while but
I won't. Long story short I've started following the
&lt;a href="https://overcomingms.org/"&gt;overcomingms&lt;/a&gt; diet/lifestyle as quite a few
people report good success with it. The book is quite compelling and it
all appears to be evidence based, albeit case studies. As someone who
knows not a lot about this stuff it's difficult to know but it's
something to give me hope so I'm running with it. The importance of
vitamin d levels in MS is stressed quite highly and, although I do
already take 5000IU of vitamin d daily, I thought that I may as well get
myself tested to find out what level I'm at. It's a pretty simple test,
prick finger, dab blood in three spots and send off to an NHS clinic,
simples.&lt;/p&gt;

warm day although quite a lot of wind, and the wind is coooold. Had a
fun ride and mostly stayed dry too. i bumped into someone I work with
and had to turn the bike to turbo just to keep up with him so that was a
decent workout and good to spend some of the ride chatting. Got a few

We left Aber at \~6am and got to Cardiff at \~8:30am, we parked in the
St. David's car park right in the centre of the city. Driving into the
bay was quite nice as it was a sunny day and getting to the car park was
hilariously easy. The convention was at the Tramshed so it was a quick
10 minute walk to get there. We arrived and found our table, right next
to the West Coast table as requested. We also requested to be near the
toilets (for me) and they certainly delivered on that front, right next
to them!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
There were talks going on throughout the day upstairs and some short
kind of intro talks on the main stage. Later in the day was also an
awards ceremony including a BAFTA. There was a pretty steady stream of
people through the day from 10-3:30 and we had quite a few people play
the game and/or stop to have a chat with us. Quite a lot of people
seemed to like the concept of the game which was nice! The game was
crashing in the second round which wasn't ideal but a few people had the
patience to wait for us to restart the game and played it a few times.
We got some good feedback and had some really good chats with various
people. People also really love the name Dirty Casuals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
There were quite a few other games/companies there too (reference). Some
really cool looking games, the best for me were &lt;a href="http://creaturebattlelab.com/"&gt;Create Battle
Lab&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="http://www.dojo-arcade.com/"&gt;Dojo
Arcade&lt;/a&gt; and Elisa Unpainted Memories by
&lt;a href="http://www.skyfishstudios.com/"&gt;Skyfish Studios&lt;/a&gt;. I also liked Eekeemoo
- Splinters of the Dark Shard by &lt;a href="http://www.itscogg.com/"&gt;Cogg Games&lt;/a&gt;.
Great to see so many polished games coming out of Wales.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After the awards wrapped up we decided to make a move and we all went
for sushi at Yo sushi! which was nice but a touch pricey. Need to learn
how to make mochi for sure!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
All in all a fun day out and hopefully we'll go again next year with a
more polished game.&lt;/p&gt;

weeks ago I had two follow up appointments; one with urodynamics and the
other with the MS nurse.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The appointment with urodynamics was made due to me having issues with
fitting the catheters so we decided I'd best go in to learn how to do
it. The appointment went well, started by going for a wee although this
time partially into a cardboard kidney tray thing. This was so that the
nurse could check for infections, it was all good! I then had the
bladder scan, this time it showed 70-90ml. This is a completely normal
level of urine to retain so we had a chat about how to proceed and
decided it's best if I keep going without catheters for now. Despite
this I still had a go with the little toy they use to demonstrate the
feel of pushing in a catheter, I can't really describe what it is other
than a tube you push the catheter down with an adjustable friction
"prostate" 3/4 of the way through it. As an aside, I also decided to buy
some &lt;a href="http://www.tena.co.uk/men/products/male/tena-men-level-2"&gt;Tena men
pads&lt;/a&gt; for
occasions where toilets are gonna be an issue. They're pretty low
profile and seem to work OK!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The second appointment, with my MS nurse, was pretty short. On entering
the consulting room she commented on my gait as it's become a bit odd
sometimes, usually if I've been sat down and my legs have stiffened up.
We basically just chatted about how everything is going and I had to go
through and sign a form about my new meds to say that I understand
things like the side effects and how to take it etc... As I say, it was
pretty short and went well I think.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The meds. Thought I'd also just write a bit about these. They've
actually been fine really, I get a burning feeling in my stomach
sometimes but not always and I get occasional toilet issues from them
but that one's rare. All in, pretty good really, to begin with I felt a
bit rough taking them for the first 1.5-2 weeks. I started out eating
poached eggs on toast with them for breakfast everyday but now I just
have a couple of spoonfuls of yoghurt with jam mixed through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
All in, things seem to be going pretty well!&lt;/p&gt;

On Thursday I had an appointment at the Urodynamics department in
Bronglais. I actually managed to park in the hospital car park for once
(yes, I drove the mile there. You try walking that far in an urban
environment with a bladder that gets upset by walking!) so was already
entering the hospital via a route that I didn't know. I eventually found
my way to the usual outpatients entrance to find it all being
refurbished and closed off. After around 15 minutes, and being guided
there, I was in the right place. One great things about these
appointments is that there's no wait at all so I was straight in with
the nurse.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We had a brief chat and then scanned my bladder, she sent me off to the
toilet and then scanned again. 130ml residual this time, which is better
than when I was scanned at Morriston and really isn't much (neither is
169 really) retention. After that we looked at my intake/output diary
for the previous 3 days (yup, that means recording volume of drinks and
then volume of urinations too), she was pretty happy with the quantity I
output in one go. I seem to average 250-300ml which is fine. We
discussed cutting out certain drinks, mostly my coffee habit. Caffeine
irritates the bladder so we decided that I'd only have 1 coffee a day -
a strong one in the morning to wake me up. I'll also only have one cup
of tea a day, I'm ok to drink decaff tea n coffee though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We got onto the topic of intermittent catheterisation, she isn't sure
it's going to do a lot for me and neither am I. Regardless, we decided
that I should give it a go and see if anything improves. Intermittent
catheters (at least of the type I've now got) are for getting rid of
retained urine. You insert it, drain off the residual and then remove it
again. She got an intermittent catheter for me to look at and it didn't
look too scary and was very, very slippery. I was also armed with a
booklet and a DVD on how to go about using it. She said that she could
either make an appointment and we'd go through everything and she'd help
me the first time or I could just take a few with me and do it myself if
I was feeling brave. I figured that there can't be much to it so took
them with the intent of reading the information and watching the DVD
before having at it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/2a4fa640-4d15-43e3-bc9b-c82e87689a9f.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried it for the first time on Friday morning, I was expecting a bit
of a struggle to insert it into my urethra but it just went straight in
with no bother. Didn't hurt at all either, could barely feel it. UNTIL
it stopped and I couldn't get it go further, not that I tried very hard,
I wasn't about to try forcing anything... It didn't hurt but as a I
pushed a bit I felt very nauseous and quite light headed so I pulled it
back out again. I didn't fancy throwing up with it in place! Some
googling has suggested that it got stuck at the prostate/bladder
entrance and to try relaxing those by changing position and/or trying to
have a wee to open things up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I tried again Saturday morning and got the same result. I decided to
take a break on Sunday and tried again the Monday night, thinking maybe
things might have relaxed during the day. Nope! Same problem but at
least no sick feeling this time, just the feeling of resignation when I
had to give up. I stopped after that attempt and now have an appointment
in a couple of weeks with the nurse and we're going to fit it together.
That'll be different...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

appointment to the letter being with me - I swear they haven't been that
quick before! This is a letter from Dr Pearson to my GP, I get CC'd in
on it. The first thing that I noticed when I looked at it was that my
&lt;a href="https://www.mstrust.org.uk/a-z/expanded-disability-status-scale-edss"&gt;EDSS&lt;/a&gt;
has dropped from 3 to 2.5, that's surely got to be good. I have mild
finger nose ataxia, which means I shake a bit going from index finger
touching nose to full arm extension. I also have slight pronator drift
in the right upper limb, and no I can't explain what that is. There's
increased tone in both of my legs but surely that could just be because
I ride bikes more than is, probably, wise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The next bit of the letter covers the new meds and possible side
effects. The final part is titled Plans. My bloods returned normal
which, whilst expected, is still a relief. Going to need blood tests
every three months I think. There's nothing else of note other than the
bit about my bladder scan. Dr Pearson says that he thinks that I require
intermittent self-catheterisation. The prospect of ramming a tube down
my urethra doesn't fill me with glee but, in all honesty, it'll be a
massive load off my mind. The ability to go into situations without
worrying about if I'm going to need the toilet or even if there is one
is not something to be easily dismissed. I hadn't really realised how
much of game changer a slightly broken bladder could be, until it
happened. I think that this is going to be subject to what the
continence team think too so I'll have to see how that develops. I'm
actually kind of hopeful for the catheter, as odd as that may sound.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
All in, pretty positive I reckon.&lt;/p&gt;

hospital. I had 2 goals going into the appointment; get something to fix
my bladder and change my MS medication. I got to the hospital and spent
5 - 10 minutes trying to park before just abandoning the car outside of
a bay but out of the way, I wasn't the first or only person doing this.
The system here at the hospital has all changed, outpatients is now
right next to the car park and it's a self check in deal with a main
waiting area filtering into smaller waiting areas. It's a lot slicker
than it used to be. I checked in and sat down to almost immediately be
called to the next waiting area. I was waiting in there for around 5
minutes before being called to my appointment. Pretty damn painless.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
In the appointment was Dr. Pearson, a student doctor and Pete (a nurse).
After pleasantries and general discussion on how it's all been since my
last appointment we got onto medication. It would appear that there have
been three new medications, that I'm eligible for, since my last visit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The first is another injection but is every 2 weeks rather than every
other day, which is what I'm on now. This has similar side effects and
effectiveness to the betaferon that I'm taking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The second is an oral medication taken daily. It also has similar
effectiveness to the betaferon but requires blood tests every 2 weeks
which quite rapidly ruled it out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The third was another oral medication, taken twice daily and is what
I've chosen to go for so long as my bloods come back OK for it. It's
called
&lt;a href="https://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/treatments-and-therapies/licensed-disease-modifying-drugs/Tecfidera"&gt;Tecfidera&lt;/a&gt;.
The active ingredient in it is called dimethyl fumarate, which isn't an
overly nice substance. The relapse rate is reduced by 53% and disability
progression by 38%, which seems pretty good to me as I'm a big fan of
having use of my legs. However, it comes with side effects. It
effectively burns it's way down the GI tract, any part of which can
react in it's own way. Be it heartburn, diarrhoea, vomiting, etc... It
also, very commonly, causes flushing so I'm going to be doing my best
tomato impression - with a sidenote of possible burning/itching effects.
So, that's all going to be fun but worth it I hope.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Tecfidera also comes with the very rare side effect of developing
&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_multifocal_leukoencephalopathy"&gt;PML&lt;/a&gt;
which is why I'd ruled it out during my own research. Dr Pearson was
able to suitably put my mind at ease on that one, it really is very
rare. They also know what's happened in previous cases where it's
developed and have measures in place for monitoring patients to catch it
before it happens. The Swansea team seems to be especially cautious on
this front.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After that discussion he did all of the normal reaction, feeling etc...
tests which showed that my balance is becoming a bit screwed and I have
some tremors, nothing that I didn't already know really but slightly
concerning anyway. I mentioned that my bladder is doing my head in and
actively altering my lifestyle and I had a bladder scan (after emptying
said bladder) with Pete. A normal person retains 100ml or less of urine
in their bladder, I had 169ml in mine. Stupid, greedy bladder. They're
going to refer me to the continence team in aber. I also get to go for
another MRI scan, I hate those. 1.5 hours of not moving and certainly
not going to the toilet. I managed to fall asleep in the machine last
time, that makes it a lot more tolerable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
He also mentioned that guys who are a bit wobbly, like me, tend to have
a slightly harder time of it in the future so it's really important to
find a medication that works for me, now. If a disability occurs then
it's too late by that point, can't reverse it but can slow or maybe stop
it happening. Not words I really wanted to hear but important to know I
think. He suggested that I do stretches as that'll also help, luckily I
already do but it's dropped to maybe 50% of days so that'll be changing
back to at least once a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Next up was the bit that I knew was going to result in a wait, blood
test. I went to check in for the blood test and was told there was a 1.5
hour wait, that wound up being 2 hours but that's life eh. All in all
not too bad and hopefully should start on the new meds in a couple of
weeks time.&lt;/p&gt;

get a chunk of the work done as progress had slowed a little. There were
three of us at the jam (at my house), we were sans musician as he
doesn't live locally. The three of us all work together so we decided to
just start once Boomer had gone home and then walked up to mine, this
gave me time to set up tables, power and get my computer moved. Once
Boomer arrived we had a bit of a general faff and got some Domino's

The Game&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;

Calamity is a multi-player survival style game. You play as a school kid
in a school where strange things have been happening. The calamity is an
event which causes monsters to come into existence. You spawn into the
game with a few of your classmates (be it human or AI controlled) pre
calamity and have a period of time before the calamity happens. What the
calamity actually is still hasn't been decided. Post calamity all of the
lights have gone out and there are suddenly monsters populating the
school. For some reason these monsters want to kill you. The idea of the
game is to be the last man standing, there are three rounds and if you
die in one round then you come back as a monster in the next. Living
players can kill each other and human monsters but the AI monsters are
invincible, part of the skill is identifying which monsters are human
and which are AI. At any point if there is only one player alive then
they win the game, if the game lasts the full three rounds then everyone
loses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
There are, at time of writing, 3 pickup items in the game. 1 weapon and
2 helper items. The weapon is used to do your killing and is a knife,
they're sparse in the game and have limited uses. There's a paper ball,
which is a throwable item used to distract the AI monsters whilst you
leg it away. The final item is the mandrake root, this makes the player
invisible to the monsters for a short period of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I think that it's a fun concept for a game which could be a lot of fun
to play. Whilst simple in design there are actually a few layers to the
gameplay and it could be quite tactical. You can team up in the
knowledge that you'll have to betray each other later or you can just go
it alone trying to kill everyone in whatever way you can think of.
There's an element of Battle Royale in there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Toothy:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/1064c0cd-03f6-4456-8efa-d6d86368c502.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Mandrake root:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/9701761b-6716-4a5e-b462-dd457e04de7b.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
RainAI&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
My first task was to make Toothy (the main monster) behave correctly as
he was a bit erratic. He should slowly patrol a set of waypoints until
he sees a player at which point he should break into a run and give
chase until the player is dead or until the player manages to lose him.
At any point a player can throw a paper ball near Toothy and he'll be
distracted by it. The distraction went through a few iterations but we
decided that he should be distracted by the audio aspect of the ball
rather than visual. If Toothy hears a ball hit the ground then he'll run
to the source of the sound before returning to what he was doing, if he
was chasing a player and the player is now out of range then he'll start
patrolling again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The AI system that Boomer chose to use is called RainAI so I stuck with
it. It took me a while to get my head into how it all works but, all in,
it's a pretty good system that hugely reduces the amount of work
required. There are several aspects to it, the main ones that I use are:
Entity rig, AI rig, Way-point network, navigation mesh and the behaviour
tree, as well as a hand full of custom scripts. The AI rig is a
component that is applied to the game object that you want to be AI
controlled. It's made up of: mind, memory, motor, animator, navigator,
senses and add-ons. I won't touch on the add-ons or animator as I didn't
touch those at all. Each of these properties comes with a basic
controller, these are pretty good anyway. You can also write your own
controllers, I just used the basic ones although I did write my own
navigator which I wound up throwing away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The mind handles things like the behaviour tree, which is where you
create all of your behaviours for your AI. Memory is like a global
variable store for your AI, the variables are accessible from RAIN
scripts and from the behaviour tree. The motor is what moves your AI,
handles speed, rotates it etc... The navigator is responsible for how
the AI will navigate waypoints and/or the navigation mesh. Finally,
senses are how your AI detects other entities. The basic sensor has
audio and visual sensors. You can set things like whether it should only
use line of sight and which layers it should see, e.g. walls.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The actual behaviour of the AI is controlled by the behaviour tree. This
is something that can take a while to get your head wrapped around but
is very effective once you do. It's difficult to explain but the tree is
composed of nodes, and there are various node types such as waypoint
patrolling, constraints, detection, custom actions, there are quite a
few! You cobble these nodes together in a manner that gives your desired
effects.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Entity rig: this is what is applied to the things that you want your AI
to interact with and detect. They can be audio or visual and are just
applied to the game object (or a child thereof) of what you want to
detect. They're really easy to set up. I'll probably write another post
on RainAI as there were a few things that I struggled to find much
information about.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
At some point on Saturday I managed to get the paper ball detection and
patrolling working correctly. We had a basic avoidance custom action so
I plugged that in too, it doesn't work quite right but it's OK for now.
After I had Toothy working how we wanted it I started work on AI
players. Again, I used a waypoint system to dictate where the player can
move and created a custom action to let the player stop and hide until
they detect a monster or another player. The avoidance script actually
seems to work OK on the players too. I'm kind of tempted to give it some
sort of artificial endocrine system but that might be a bit much for
this!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Waypoints:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/e303a58a-207a-4cc7-9cbf-e9ff4696eb83.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Behaviour tree:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/26e9590e-1a61-4705-85c2-322b3fa2e179.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Whilst I was doing this stuff Boomer was working through getting other
stuff done like making the menu systems, making the mandrake root effect
work, sounds, level design. The man gets a lot done! Elysia churned out
rad artwork all weekend and did work on level and UI design too. I feel
like I've made light of the amount of work that they did there. We
worked until 1am on Friday and Saturday nights and around 10pm on
Sunday, was definitely a really fun weekend. It felt like we got quite a
lot done and the game is becoming very playable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Boomer and I have decided that, going forward, he's going to work on the
multi-player stuff, i.e. making it. I'll work on lighting and shading to
try make things look shiny. There's a helluva lot for me to learn on
that and I'm looking forward to expanding my knowledge about it all. So
far I've managed to make a moon (with Elysia's help for the artwork and
Unity pointers) which uses some emission for glow and a simple
directional light with a low intensity. I'm planning on writing shaders
to put in the windows to make moon rays shining into the buildings, that
should be a challenge. I have a feeling that rays are probably a mix of
some sort of refraction and dust. Given that this is aimed at webgl I'm
not sure dust modeling is going to fly but i might be able to fake it
somehow. I think that I'm starting to get my head round emissions now
and, on Boomer's suggestion, plan on using them quite a lot rather than
lights as lights are seemingly expensive. Lots to learn and lots to do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Level design of the first level:  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/034c6a87-d337-4572-b2e0-b573675f9a93.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

bikes with some old friends from Shropshire, as well as the weekend I
also had Monday and Friday off. We were staying a couple of miles south
of Builth Wells in the arse end of nowhere, but this meant that I was
driving through Rhayader to get there. This also meant that, on my way
down, the possibility of a ride in the Elan Valley was very much on the
cards. I did some hunting on strava and discovered a loop entitled
"Clive Powell's VERY challenging challenge ride 2016". The hint should
have been that this was a 40km loop that the guy had completed in 2
hours and even he thought that it was VERY challenging.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I got to Rhayader at around 10:30-11 and did the usual faffing including
paying for a £3.20(!) parking ticket. I was expecting to know a few bits
of the ride from last year's transcambrian but very quickly I found
myself going off in a direction that I didn't know. I rode on roads for
long enough that I was starting to wonder if the route was actually a
road ride but stuck with it as it was a nice day and the views are great
so it could have been worse anyway... Nope, after a little while I
picked up a bridleway and was somewhat relieved. I rode through some
woods for a little while before embarking on my first descent of the
day, a really fast bit of dirt singletrack. Pretty nice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nice

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I was then met with a mixture of bit more road and easy track for a
little while. As a part of this track was the most swayingest suspension
bridge I've ever been on, it moved in just about every direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cyclists

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After a while the route joined onto a hardpack, double track, bridleway.
This was a brute. A pretty steep, pretty long climb. Strava puts it at
11% for 1.1km, the segment is called "Breathing out of every hole to the
farm" and is quite accurate... At least the surface was decent and I
made it up without too much trouble although almost gave up during one
really steep bit, but I didn't! Through the farm and I rode along the
top of the one of the hills which offered some pretty rad views and also
encountered some rather stubborn cows that were not for letting me stay
on the road to get past them. This was followed by losing quite a lot of
elevation on a fireroad which didn't fill me with joy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Nice
view" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/--CniC8ytR6g/Vu_3i69jNcI/AAAAAAAAKCQ/7aF3d9MvuuI8e19sKtnxHo44CCYfkEqmwCCo/s640-Ic42/P1010287.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I followed along a road for a while until I saw a steep road leading off
up the hill to my left, a feeling of inevitability crept in and then I
realised that I recognised where I was. This was the stupid steep road
that we'd done on the transcambrian. At 15% but only 0.6km I think that
it was actually easier than the farm climb was, I was glad to get up it
in one go. I followed the same route as the transcambrian for a little
while, starting out with a flatout grass descent on which I managed to
go the wrong way a couple of times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Puke

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The route then climbed back up until undulating a little bit over
fields, offering fantastic views out over the reservoirs. I was
beginning to get worried that the route was going to continue following
the transcambrian onto my least favourite part of that day but luckily
it split right instead of left, hurrah! Instead of following down the
really rocky, hard going, double track, the route ran parallel on a
road. Much nicer. After a while it was time to go back offroad and into
another climb.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This climb started out on tall grass in a bog. I was beginning to fear
the worst, a long push to get up the field. Luckily I pushed up a little
bit and a rocky doubletrack appeared, this was a relief as I could
actually ride it. It took me up for quite a while until I reached some
sort of weather station. After this the fun really began. The descent
started out as flatout down a grass field before going through a gate
and becoming dirt singletrack through the woods, across a fireroad and
into rocky singletrack. This was a great descent, really long and pretty
varied. Bits of it reminded me of the Dyfi. Definitely the best bit of
the day. At the bottom of this I crossed a dam and was faced with a
choice. Do I keep following the route or do I follow the road back to
Rhayader? I was feeling quite tired but it looked like the route
followed a cycle path the long way round to Rhayader so I thought that
I'd stick with it. Mistake. Big mistake.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Crossing the
dam" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-vv1dCqXL6qU/Vu_3i6QcrrI/AAAAAAAAKCQ/qqg2-dI7i6kwaiaqR3IfZcwRyyl9VVdqwCCo/s640-Ic42/P1010296.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The route did follow the cycle path for quite a while before suddenly
turning off up a bridleway that there was no way I was riding up,
luckily the steep bit was only short and I was back on the bike on
doubletrack pretty quickly. This gave way to grass. I hate grass. The
climb was just steep enough, and me tired enough, that I was off and
walking, and walking, and walking. Walking uphill really messes with my
legs quite badly and my right foot was beginning to feel heavy and I was
having to pep talk myself into just keeping going. It seemed that this
moorland climb was endless but eventually I reached the top of it. It'd
gone cold and all I could see was more moorland. I was feeling pretty
demoralised at this point, but at least I could get on the bike and spin
a low gear so every cloud has a silver lining n that. It'd hit the point
where I was having to lift my right leg to put my foot on the correct
bit of the pedal and I couldn't lift my foot to the top of the stroke to
place it on the pedal any more either. This is starting to moderately
concern me as it seems to be happening more frequently as time goes by
but a bit of a rest and a section where I can spin and it usually
rectifies itself. I'll just continue to not think too hard about it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I followed the trail, for what seemed like forever, and eventually it
started to point downhill. By this point I was knackered and just took
it very steady as the trail descended to a road. I was very, very happy
to hit this road which was pointing downhill for quite some time. I
started riding down it for a while and I saw that I was off course. Sod
it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I pressed on assuming that it'd drop me into Rhayader, there were a
couple of moments where I was off the OS mapping on my garmin that I
have for the area where it looked like it was going to take me into a
different valley but it came sweet for me. It dropped a very cold, very
tired me into Rhayader. I rapidly packed the car and pressed on to
Builth, despite the heating being on full blast I think it still took
until near Builth before I stopped feeling cold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
All in, it was definitely a VERY challenging route but I discovered a
couple of pretty rad descents. It's not a route I'm ever going to ride
again but I think that it showed me some good stuff and I did enjoy most
of it. The fella who I nabbed the route off on strava had managed to
complete the ride in under half the time that it took me! My garmin was
playing the "virtual partner route complete" jingle before I'd even hit
half way, had to laugh. Had I turned right instead of left at the dam
then I think that I'd have been pretty happy, a bit too much road for my
liking but fun and it really is an awesome place with fantastic views.&lt;/p&gt;

around half ten and after faffing around were ready to ride at around
eleven. We were riding up rather than on the uplift as it's always
booked up and the ride up isn't so bad. This was the first time I'd been
there when it wasn't raining. We managed to get in 2 whole runs and 2
half runs which doesn't sound a lot but having done Cadair yesterday it
was enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
First up we decided to ride viscious valley down to the fire road. I
enjoy this trail, it's maybe a bit less rocky than others and a bit more
rooty. On the spin back to the top we decided to get another run in and
go down to the bottom to have lunch before the uplift stopped for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Our run down to lunch was the new blue, Terry's Belly. Fair play to them
that is a seriously long run for the UK. It's pretty fun but the same
the whole way down really so did get a bit samey. Definitely a good
workout though, my feet were cramping by the bottom.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Lunch was pretty good, we both went for the standard bike park Wales
burger. The burger was pretty tasty and quite dense so really filling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Haul back up to the top and we decided that we'd do viscious valley into
coal not dole as I remembered liking that trail too. I managed to ride
straight off the trail as it went into the trees, the contrasting light
left me totally blind! Well it was a good choice anyway, coal not dole
is fun, few small drops and quite fast. We decided to finish that run
off with deep navigation just to get our hit of rock, also a fun trail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After that neither of us fancied a jaunt back to the top so we just went
up to the fire road and we decided to do pork belly into the red to the
bottom. Pork belly was ok but nothing great really. The red was very
fast and had some decent sized jumps in it. I popped off of a rock
kicker not realising it was a double and duly landed on the up slope of
the landing, glad I was on the full sus!&lt;/p&gt;

rainy weather. The first few km were road and then fireroad, that
changed to a couple of km of rutty, holey grass which was a bit push and
a bit ride up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After that it was all pushing as it was nothing but rocks. To begin with
the rocks were kind of large like paving slabs made into steps but after
a bit become loose rocks of varying sizes, mostly baby head sized. The
view up was pretty daunting at this point but luckily the path wasn't
quite so bad...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The whole while pushing this bit we were scoping lines, lines that we
later totally ignored... On the video you can hear me shouting at Taylor
for taking the hardest line down the worst bit, I didn't realise until I
was already on it. Toward the top we started to be treated to some
decent views. We were nearly at cloud level so it was quite cool looking
out and having the top part of the occluded by cloud. Kinda hard to
explain, a photo does it better!&lt;/p&gt;

We didn't go quite to the summit but got near, the very last bit was
quite busy with walkers and look quite difficult to ride so we just
didn't bother with it. The view from up there was pretty decent too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="View from the

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It took us around 2 hours 40 to get up there, around 800m elevation and
12km distance. We had some food and then DOWN. The top rocky bit was a
little bit rad, properly technical and fun. At the bottom of that bit I
saw a view that I thought might make a nice panorama, so I photo'd it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/4aa55625-f164-4c4b-9036-49df0597317e.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After that it was still fun but nowhere near as good! We made our own
little off piste way down some of the grass just to make it a bit more
interesting and then it was just the fireroad. A good day out and one
I'm happy I've finally ticked off the list. Also pretty rad to have
ridden up and down a mountain in Wales!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I stitched together some video of the top, it felt a loooot faster than
it looks! We also had a bit of a moment at the end of the video.&lt;/p&gt;

Today was supposed to be the woods and Nant. Taylor said that he

loop. It took me until around 3pm to actually get going and do anything,
I went to t&lt;span&gt;he woods&lt;/span&gt; and had a rad couple of hours. Taylor
rang me to say that he'd be too late for a ride so I just stayed a bit
longer than I'd planned. I rode the same short section about 11 times it
was so good!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today I stayed over the side with the main lines on it and didn't
venture over the other side, I spent most of my time riding the top
sections trying to get them fast. I also decided to try out both lines
on the dual slalom track, I stacked it on both. More slippery than a
slippery thing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Believe it or not but it took me 11 attempts to get round this corner
cleanly, even then it wasn't fast...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A spot of falling off&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

I spent around 4 hours today in the woods, half of that was probably
working on my new track. I've got one fallen tree left to take out and a
bit of dirt to pile on other and the top half of it'll be ridable. I
need to clear a bit of undergrowth and then properly cut in a rut and
it'll be done. It works well as the push up as is, much easier than
pushing up the other track and should open up scope for building a load
of other tracks more easily.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After building I rode the steep line a couple of times and then the top
of Nick's into the rock garden track. Wasn't many runs but my legs were
pretty tired from the building so I left it at that, the slickness was
also scaring me a little!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt;



&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a wee tumble too:&lt;/p&gt;

Well I have the next week off so some biking is going to occur. Despite
being worried back in February that 10 days of holiday (not including
bank holidays) wouldn't be enough to last me 6 months it turns out that
I've rolled over 4 days into the new calendar year. As I haven't had a
week off since Feb I thought that I'd use these 4 days as it's a bank
holiday week. I've also managed to get Taylor to come join me from
Monday - Friday, riding is always better with other people! My plan of
action is:

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday - Brechfa&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday - Capel Dewi for digging and riding&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monday - T&lt;span&gt;he woods&lt;/span&gt; in the morning and then meet Taylor
    at nant in the afternoon and ride a bit of the off piste too&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tuesday - Bike Park Wales without uplift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wednesday - Cadair Idris&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thursday - Antur Stiniog uplift&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Friday - Dyfi&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Saturday - Maybe the Marin?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sunday - Be depressed that the riding week has ended&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

Now a couple of these are weather permitting but should be a good week!

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/0c5c0138-ee8e-4f75-bbd4-a280d5fdc236.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So today, I went down to Brechfa with the intention of riding the red &amp;amp;
black. First descent I almost had a bit of an incident as I slipped a
pedal off one of the kickery things, seems to be a tradition for to do
that off at least one of them now. Had a bit of pedal to shin interface
and just lost all power down that leg for a bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the second(?) descent I did actually manage to have a stack. I
decided to double up a couple of whoops but my brain failed to inform my
legs of this decision. I landed on top of the second whoop and just lost
control a bit before landing on my face in the grass. Nothing bad
luckily!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rest of the ride was pretty uneventful but was fun. I decided against
doing the black in the end as my legs were feeling a bit stiff and
wooden and I have another week of riding to go yet :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

give it a bash though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
What is it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
It's a 104 mile route that snakes across (and a bit up) Wales, starting
at Knighton (Shropshire border) and ending at Dovey Junction (near
Machynlleth). It's usually done as a 3 day trip so we decided to do it
in 1. We being Harris and I.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
We were far from being the first people to do this and there have been
some very, very impressive times done in the past. I think it's been
done in under 10 hours!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Why?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Well, firstly because I wanted to. Simple as. Also, though, it seemed
like a good opportunity to try to raise some money, and awareness, for
the &lt;a href="http://www.mssociety.org.uk/"&gt;MS Society&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
How'd it go?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Brutal. Utterly brutal. I'd prepared for the distance, I'd prepared for
the elevation (OK I hadn't prepared for quite that much!) but I had not
prepared for the grass. It was a long, long ride but we managed it,
although we did cut to Machynlleth at the end instead. It was 2230 by
the time that we had hit the last point where we could go to Mach
instead of Dovey Junction so the choice wasn't difficult. So, from the
top...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
3am my alarm went off, I forced down 3.5 weetabix (couldn't face the
other 1.5), threw my food in the car and left for Knighton. En-route I
also picked up Ben. I don't function at all well before 7am so Ben's
attempts at conversation were mostly met by grunts whilst my brain tried
to shut itself down. We got to Knighton at around 4:30 without my
falling asleep and after faffage set off just before 5. I was feeling
pretty ropey at this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Ben in

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I don't really want to write a blow by blow account so I think that I'll
pick some photos from the ride and just put down a few words about each.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Grass,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This first picture was one of the first climbs, it was one of many grass
ones. The one that we'd just got up was a hike with a bike, and also
grass! Draggy, draggy grass. For me, the grassy sections were the
hardest part of the ride by quite some way. The second picture is just
some sheep! After a while the grass gave way to dirt track which was
much, much nicer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="River

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Ahh river crossings, there were a few of these too although this was the
first of the day. Later in the day we had to pass through a quite deep,
fast one in the Hafren which I had a jolly refreshing lie down in. Less
than ideal!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Cycle

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This path was just after Rhayader so roughly 1/3 in and was a few,
welcome, quick kilometers on a fast surface away from the cars. After
all of that grass it was quite nicely different. The gpx route that we
were following was split into 3 parts, Rhayader marked the end of part 1
which was psychologically a big milestone. These milestones got a lot
more important the further in that we got; half way, end of part 2,
100km etc... Another big boost was reaching bits that I already knew.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Elan valley

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The cycle path took us to Elan Valley. I'd never ridden in the Elan
Valley before but have wanted to for some time. It was really quite
beautiful. We climbed up a meandering road for a while and gained a fair
bit of height before hitting, what was practically, a road wall. Blimey
it was steep! After that we wound up on... grass again! Although, after
the grass was a long flat track that was as rocky as a rocky thing which
at least kept the mind active trying to pick the way! Quite a few large
pools of water in this part of the world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Looking
back" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-zuEiLNUyj7w/Vb3hCFQhIEI/AAAAAAAAIhw/sAjw7h9fWKU/s640-Ic42/P1010132.JPG"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The end of the track dropped us at the bottom of this dam. We had to
cross the river by riding through it before crossing it again on the
bridge. We rode round and up to the top of it before riding around the
reservoir itself to the other end. We to-and-fro'd with another couple
of guys at this point. Later on we caught them up again and had a bit of
a natter. They were riding day 2 of the transcambrian and were mightily
impressed that we were going for the lot in a day. We saw them a lot
more times and also wound up in a handy position where we'd open gates
and they'd pop up just in time to close them. A couple of more climbs
and I knew where we were! Up on the road above the teifi pools.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Ben

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
En-route to the Teifi Pools (bottom pic) Ben managed to slice his tyre,
a pretty good slash n all. Luckily I had a tyre boot so we threw that in
and away we went. Actually, I had 2 boots which was a good job as he
later also sliced the boot! We followed the route that I'd done before
with the Ystwyth crew for a while before starting to head back toward
Llangurig. For some reason I'd thought this section would be really
easy, the bit from Cwmystwyth was pretty horrible but rideable though.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Pigs" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-d8LjLTLilNA/Vb3ihUwF6VI/AAAAAAAAIi4/v3pNo82YRpk/s640-Ic42/P1010141.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I've managed to skip a pretty huge distance here! Llangurig to Foel
Fadian but to be honest there wasn't a lot of note. A load of great
views but that's about it! Although it looked like there was some good
riding to be had in the Hafren Forest, and of course my little lie down
in the river. The top of Foel Fadian itself was covered in chippings
which was pretty exciting! After that it was flat out on grass and then
fireroad, I'd given up caring about self preservation by this point and
boy did the ground move fast! We continued on our merry way from the
bottom until we joined the fireroad that leads to the zigzag climb on
the Mach3 loop. The route went the opposite way to the climb (so did
we!) luckily. There was almost a crisis of sense of humor loss at this
point. I had thought the bit from here to Dovey Junction would be back
roads and easy, seems not. Took me a few minutes but I identified a road
straight to Mach. Instead of turning off the road after a bit to follow
the route we just kept on it to Forge and then Mach. With what I
estimated to be an hour riding left, on unknown terrain, we thought that
we'd best call it a day and get to our lifts. We only cut to Mach
because we were considering the people waiting for us, honest ;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/c3c469ba-6d95-43b2-a8b5-83db976b4d06.jpg"&gt;{width="4000"
height="3000"}&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Well that was it, that was the end. Coop car park. Man it felt good! A
phone call was placed, our lifts were in the pub together. I saw that
one coming but glad that they weren't just sat bored in the cars. 164km
distance, 3984m elevation climbed and 17h40mins total. Big day out! Glad
that I did, it's one to tick off but I won't be riding it again in a
hurry. It was very pretty but not really the sort of riding that I enjoy
most, a lot of descending was on road/fireroad which I had expected, to
be fair. Next weekend I'm going to everest the leg burner. That's a lie.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Quite possibly best of all we also managed to raise just over £2000 for
the MS Society which is awesome, thank you so so much to everyone who
has donated.&lt;/p&gt;

that I've really wanted to do. As an aside I've attempted a ride with
2km of elevation a few times and always failed too. A couple of weeks
ago I decided to set the May bank holiday at the end of May as the one.
Ben said that he was up for it too so I set about plotting a route.
100km is actually not that easy to plot, it's quite a long way! I knew
that the mach n back from nant is circa 60km, so riding from home would
push that to 75km. A few tweaks to the route to add in some extra riding
and there we go, 100km.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Sunday morning rolled around, I opened my blinds and couldn't even see
the houses the other side of the garden, utterly miserable weather. We
had breakfast, got ready and rolled out at around 9am. Stoke was low as
we were soaked before even getting to Penrhyncoch but once you're wet you're wet and at least it was warm.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Dismal

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="View over

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
We picked up the conti trail at Bont Goch and headed straight out to to
Syfydrin then Nant-y-moch, continuining to follow the conti loop. First,
and only, mechanical of the day - I got a flat, something managed to
poke a hole in my tubeless tyre but tube in and we were away again. We
kept following the trail until the descent down to Hinterland valley,
midway down this descent the cloud parted and we finally actually got a
bit of a view.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Hinterland
valley" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-EZgGKAvBoeQ/VWLagStgqLI/AAAAAAAAHy0/3WeXVLXjLC8/s640/P1000926.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Onward we went up to the hockey mask descent which was rather rad, as
usual. After that we started heading more directly toward mach. We hit a
very, very slow section as we had to walk up a big gulley which took use
quite a long time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Big
gulley" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-uW583qpRuhY/VWLajTGZK-I/AAAAAAAAHy0/n0c5SaBP_D4/s640/P1000930.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After that though it was plain sailing up to the chute. The chute itself
was great, top totally on bedrock before becoming incredibly loose and
shaley. By this point the day had brightened up and was really quite
lovely. On we went until we descended the golf course and found
ourselves in mach.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="The

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Spar for food and then we continued, nack toward nant. We knew that the
way back was mostly climb and that was a little disconcerting. None of
the climbs were as bad as we had remembered and gave us no problems.
What was a problem was that I developed a splitting headache at around
60km and anything that was rocky just made it worse. I couldn't work out
what was causing it and we had no choice but to keep going. Normally on
a mach n back at Hyddgen we'd turn right and do Scaletrix but I'd
plotted this route a bit different so we continued on toward
Nant-y-moch. This trail was incredibly rocky and was doing my head
absolutely no favours. I felt so bad that I couldn't even be arsed to
navigate off to the bridge so we waded through the river, it was only
knee height so not too bad! We had some food at this point including a
load of wine gums, this I think was significant. After a while we got to
Nant-y-moch crossed the dam and cracked on round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I had planned that we'd ride the Pencerrig descent but given my head I
decided that'd likely be a bad idea so we rode the Syfydrin (section
we'd already ridden) backward. My head had actually started to feel
better by this point and by the time we were back at the Summit trail I
was feeling fine. I'm reasonably confident that it was food/sugar
related. We did a loop of the Pendam trail and the 100 was in sight.
Down the moorlands and the new top of zorro before heading back via
Banc-y-darren. We both hit 100km on the way back and even the climb back
up to the Waun wasn't bad. Bike is need of some TLC now, even though I
gave it a full overhaul on Saturday!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="Sunny
Syfydrin" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-phUrgHgfzJ8/VWLaoqZMtYI/AAAAAAAAHy0/Wtrpb-C0xO0/s640/P1000938.JPG"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
So we managed the 100km and also managed to rack up 2300m of climbing.
We both also managed it quite comfortably, neither of us were struggling
by the end and both felt quite good. The average pace 9.3km/h which is a
bit slower than I'd like but tt's good to know that I'm capable of the
distance and some lessons were learnt. The big one being food related. A
cracking ride with a mixed bag of terrain, trails and weather!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

was going to ride it this year: see how quick I could get round or just
chill out and socialize. I knew that Ben and Steph would taking it at a
sociable pace so figured that I'd just ride the new bike and match pace
with them. Well, that didn't happen! I stopped for a toilet break on the
road out and the group rode on, somehow we all got separated, I managed
to pass both Ben's and Steph without noticing and it was only half way
up the first climb I figured that I passed them so just decided to crack
on. At the top of the first climb a familiar face caught me up, Harris
had appeared. We rode together for the rest of the event at a casual
pace and just enjoyed it. We figured that we must have passed Rich or
he'd gone off well ahead. At the finish line he turned up just after us,
he'd done the long loop. He spent the first half of the loop trying to
catch up with Harris, he gave up thinking that Harris must have been
well ahead. Hohoho we had a good laugh about that, well Rich less so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/3809fe51-540a-40e2-aacb-858e83177f00.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
The ride was quite uneventful really, Harris got a puncture but that was
the only issue that we had. I had a bit of a moment down world cup when
I was certain I going to ride into someone walking down. If you're gonna
walk then that's fair enough but don't walk on the main line(s)! It was
definitely the hardest Dyfi I've done purely down to conditions, the
weather hadn't been good so the fireroads were like riding on glue!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img alt="" src="/images/d8e4e33e-b1fa-4609-ab93-24a6a7f2e31a.jpg"&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="/images/821fd4f0-747e-4ad6-a28d-2a31ff54ce18.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
After the riding we had a beer and burger whilst waiting for Ben n Steph
and then once everyone was showered and beer'd we headed to the pizza
place at the Wynnstay. Jolly good it was too! Whilst waiting for Ben n
Steph we also managed to pick up a Dan as his train had been cancelled
so he was in need of a place to stay for the night. Was nice catching up
with him too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
Another cracking Dyfi Enduro, big thanks to everyone involved in the
running of it!&lt;/p&gt;

milestone to stop at. I wanted to try make each photo have a bit of

not to mention that I didn't always manage that in what I did actually

time to bring it to a stop.

I'd not done before.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first new one linked the highest bit of the mountain road down to
the bont goch climb, making more climb before getting to nant. It
started off downhill on a double track before turning into a single
track. It was almost like whoops but shorter and begging to catch the
front wheel. It then had a short grassy climb before an open grassy
descent to the other climb. I managed to do over 500m climb by the time
I got to hippity hop.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next I headed out on the Joe's back garden loop as far as the reservoir.
I then followed the road round and rode the splashdown climb to
angler's, by this point I was a bit worried about time before dark so
went straight for the bridleway. All that I can really say about it is
that the track isn't well defined and wasn't great! Oh well.&lt;/p&gt;

the way up through Banc y darren but pretty much as soon as I reached
the Nant area the clouds parted and the sun came out to play! I stopped
at the cafe for a, massive, wedge of cake and a cup of coffee - very
nice. I then decided to go out on the Syfydrin trail where I got some
amazing views over the lakes, a combination of fog and sun. After the
first part of the Bont Goch descent, at the gate, I stopped and realised
that there was complete silence. Not a sound to be heard, other than the
ringing in my ears - didn't realise how bad that was! It was quite an
awesome moment and really reminded me how important it was that I didn't
crash out there. Rad ride.&lt;/p&gt;

quite bored by the time I got to the end of Bow Street and very nearly
just went to Borth and back but I wanted to check out the climb from
Talybont to Anglers. The climb was quite long but not bad and it was
sunny so quite enjoyable really. As I rounded the corner at the top the
sun disappeared and it got really cold, oh and ice. I was taking it nice
and steady but on the road down to Nant-y-moch I hit a big sheet of ice.
As it was downhill I was gathering speed fast and despite knowing I
shouldn't brake I felt that I had to before I stacked it at a higher
speed, down I went. Bit of a grazed knee and my face hit first but
luckily my face landed in the snow on the grass as the side of the road.
By the time I reached where Syfydrin meets Nant-y-moch I was fed up and
decided that riding the loop backward was the quickest way to get me on
a road home. It was by far the most interesting part of the ride...
Despite the ride being rubbish and me confirming that I dislike road
biking I did manage to find a view I hadn't seen before and took a snap.&lt;/p&gt;

to back the rebound off a touch as compressing the forks always wound up
with the front wheel in the air but they're like riding on a magic
carpet. Very happy with them. I managed to take a few photos today and
had all sorts of weather but my choice as my photo for the day is of
this bird. It was flitting around my feet eating the bits of cake that I

he gave me was less than a new frame + headset so we went ahead with the
deal. Today I got round to starting to move all the bits over to the new

fun ride and nice to have a good catchup too. The ride had one downer in
that White Fridge is currently unridable due to logging, gutted.
Hopefully it won't be too hard to rescue once they remove the logs and

time to try buy a ticket, luckily he was able to. We got there around
10:30 and signed on then we started riding at around 11. It was a rad
event and we managed 2 very sociable laps. The loop was really good and
took in Builth and 3in1 which are Dyfi classics, the first lap also went
down Elephant. On the second lap we did a cheeky little loamy trail that
runs alongside part of 3in1 which was really rad too. Top day out and
saw loads of familiar faces!&lt;/p&gt;

I'm staying is making a photo a bit more difficult. Today we have a
photo of my Toshiba Chromebook. It's a good little machine. Boots fast
and I like ChromeOS. Aside from the trackpad it also feels more
expensive than it is. The only main complaint I have with it is that the
fan gets quite loud. I assumed that this was a fault and sent it off on
warranty but was stuck with a bill as they marked it as no fault found -
guess the volume meets their acceptable limits but not mine.  &lt;/p&gt;

been a little lost what to photo. I'm still keen to not just take photos
or random stuff and want things that I can write a bit of something
about. So today is an indiscriminate bottle of clear liquid. I joke,
it's a bottle of the beer that I recently brewed. After seeing someone
recommend it online I used a &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Bulldog-Home-brew-American-Double/dp/B00GTW7HCW"&gt;Evil Dog Double
IPA&lt;/a&gt;
kit as I wanted to ensure that what I brewed tasted drinkable. The
procedure was quite simple -  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;mix in bucket, put somewhere warm, siphon to bottles. The beer has come
clear quite nicely but once the cap comes off it goes really cloudy. Not
sure why! The bottles will be moved from the house to the garage soon to
see if being cool helps with that. The beer itself tastes quite nice
although tastes quite strong as well. It's very drinkable!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

yesterday that I was going to have to bail due to my cold. I arranged to
do a bit of nant ride with Andy as he was over this way surfing this
morning. I also really, really wanted to show him toboggan. We started
the ride with it and, as I expected, he had no problems and thought it
was great. The rest of the ride was quite good fun but I was taking it
very easy trying not to get out of breath and make my chest hurt too
much. It hurt a lot anyway and I generally felt quite rubbish so I
skipped High as a Kite and Hippity Hop. So, today's photo is Andy
looking out down the valley with a few red kites floating around.&lt;/p&gt;

The idea is that each month you get sent a box with the spices for a

choice of "Friday Night Curry", "World Kitchen" and "Date Night". For me
this was a choice of World Kitchen and Date Night, I have enough curry
spices as it is! Despite being single I went for Date Night as it's a 3
course meal for 2, so it'll do me for 2 nights.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
This month's box is Sri Lanka, the menu is: Tomato rasam, coconut and
fish curry and love cake. I'm quite excited to make this meal, it's
going to have to wait a week though! It also came with a little detox
spices sachet, the idea of these spices is a simple dish full of spices
to aid with digestion. The 2 dishes they suggest are a lassi and a dahl,
I'll be trying the dahl for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

my pelican setup works. For this reason I decided to change the
technology behind my blog. Moving away from using pelican and hosting on
github pages to &lt;a href="http://postach.io/"&gt;Postachio&lt;/a&gt;. Postachio is a blogging
platform that ties into a handful of sources, including dropbox which is
where all of my blog posts already are. It also accepts markdown as a
file type for posts, again suits what I already have. Postachio is free,
although I have opted to pay the small monthly amount to give a bit of
support. Unfortunately, at time of publishing this post it appears that
the Dropbox integration has been disabled for some time so this post
comes to you from a new source to me, Evernote!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
When I initially registered, got my posts on and changed my domain to
point at the new place there was no option for custom themes. The theme
editor was offline to be rewritten. I used a boilerplate theme from
their selection of precreated ones. A month or so later they unveiled
the &lt;a href="http://help.postach.io/editing-your-theme-with-github"&gt;new theme
creator&lt;/a&gt;. It's
quite rad really. You create a github repo that holds your custom theme
(you can also &lt;a href="https://github.com/postachio"&gt;fork one of theirs&lt;/a&gt; and
edit it) and then link your blog to it. Done! The templating language
is, once again matching what I already had experience with, jinja2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
I forked the apex theme and spent quite a while trying to get a design
that I wanted. I wanted something simple and fully reponsive to all
devices, but I do not like messing about with CSS. I couldn't get what I
wanted and in the end I decided to just strip out as much CSS as I
possibly could. As close to bearbones as I could get and still have
something of a modicum of a design. I like it, I don't really care if
you do :p. Happy Christmas!&lt;/p&gt;
