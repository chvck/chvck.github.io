Another normal day, fog still doesn't seem to have lifted from
yesterday. Elysia was out tonight so I was sat in work wondering what to
eat and quite fancied cajun spiced tuna steak with crispy potatoes.
Turns out that tuna steak isn't so easy to come by these days, so …&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Dixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 08:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2017-02-23:/posts/2017/Feb/23/day-53-photo-a-day-2017/</guid><category>photo-a-day-2017</category><category>food</category></item><item><title>Day 52 - photo a day 2017</title><link>/posts/2017/Feb/22/day-52-photo-a-day-2017/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

I actually did something different this evening, and totally forgot to
take a photo. At least it's something that'll happen again so I can get
it next time. Anyway, luckily I took a backup photo. The fantastic view
from the office today... This didn't lift for the entire day.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This is getting a bit tedious due to my day to day life just not being
that interesting. Another day of same old, except today I baked a cake.
It's an orange cocoa cake, no eggs or milk or anything. It tastes really
good and does actually have the texture …&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Dixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2017 08:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2017-02-21:/posts/2017/Feb/21/day-51-photo-a-day/</guid><category>photo-a-day-2017</category><category>food</category></item><item><title>Day 50 - photo a day 2017</title><link>/posts/2017/Feb/20/day-50-photo-a-day-2017/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

I've spent most of today working on gamebuildr so haven't had anything
exciting to photo. Elysia got given some raw wool recently and she
started to sort it today, picking things like straw and twigs out and
then washing it. I briefly helped with the picking things out bit.

For a while now I've been looking at sleep trackers with an eye to try

This morning I was sat in work looking out wishing I was riding my bike,

Well, definitely nothing of interest today. Here's a photo of Mexican
stuffed Portobello mushrooms! Very tasty they were too.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

This one isn't a happy fun time photo but part of the point of this was
as a partial ongoing log. It's an incontinence bed protector pad thing.

My most recent bike purchase. I'm trying to get as many tools etc... on

Got to bed at 5:30 this morning having spent a lot of the night

Ben and I made a trip into the Malverns on our bikes, we gave up at the

This weekend we're celebrating Ed's 30th birthday. We've booked an old
manor house just next to the Malvern Hills, the house is rather
impressive...

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced

which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.
