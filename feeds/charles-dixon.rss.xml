Another normal day, fog still doesn't seem to have lifted from
yesterday. Elysia was out tonight so I was sat in work wondering what to
eat and quite fancied cajun spiced tuna steak with crispy potatoes.
Turns out that tuna steak isn't so easy to come by these days, so …&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Dixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 23 Feb 2017 08:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2017-02-23:/posts/2017/Feb/23/day-53-photo-a-day/</guid><category>photo-a-day-2017</category><category>food</category></item><item><title>Day 52 - photo a day</title><link>/posts/2017/Feb/22/day-52-photo-a-day/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

I actually did something different this evening, and totally forgot to
take a photo. At least it's something that'll happen again so I can get
it next time. Anyway, luckily I took a backup photo. The fantastic view
from the office today... This didn't lift for the entire day.

This is getting a bit tedious due to my day to day life just not being
that interesting. Another day of same old, except today I baked a cake.
It's an orange cocoa cake, no eggs or milk or anything. It tastes really
good and does actually have the texture …&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Dixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2017 08:43:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2017-02-21:/posts/2017/Feb/21/day-51-photo-a-day/</guid><category>photo-a-day-2017</category></item><item><title>Day 50 - photo a day</title><link>/posts/2017/Feb/20/day-50-photo-a-day/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

I've spent most of today working on gamebuildr so haven't had anything
exciting to photo. Elysia got given some raw wool recently and she
started to sort it today, picking things like straw and twigs out and
then washing it. I briefly helped with the picking things out bit.

This one isn't a happy fun time photo but part of the point of this was

As I've done \~800km on the levo now I felt like it was probably about
(past) time to service the shock and forks. Nothing hugely involved,
just an air can service for the shock and lowers for the forks. After
doing the shock my bike developed an odd knocking word …&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Dixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2017 09:57:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2017-02-09:/posts/2017/Feb/09/day-39-photo-a-day/</guid><category>photo-a-day-2017</category></item><item><title>Day 38 - photo a day</title><link>/posts/2017/Feb/08/day-38-photo-a-day/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

This is getting difficult now, once again I've done nothing of interest

Not a whole lot to say about today... I left work quite late and picked
Elysia up from work so decided to pop into Coffee No.1 whilst I waited
for her to finish. I'd only been once before. I had a decaff standard

Went for a ride out to nant-y-moch today, it was really low which was
odd. I'm still wondering why. The new tyres feel pretty awesome,
definitely preferring them to the plus tyres.

You can probably imagine how happy I was to find cake recipes in the oms
cookbook. I had a flick through and decided to make an orange cake
although I also added some cocoa to it. It's nice and has the texture of
normal cake so definitely happy!

The 50mph gusts showing on the weather forecasts should have put me off
riding, but they didn't. I didn't quite get as far as nant, I couldn't
hold the bike on the road. I kept veering off into the verge and I was
pretty sure that when the area became …&lt;/div&gt;</description><dc:creator xmlns:dc="http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/">Charles Dixon</dc:creator><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2017 22:55:00 +0000</pubDate><guid isPermaLink="false">tag:None,2017-02-02:/posts/2017/Feb/02/day-33-photo-a-day/</guid><category>photo-a-day-2017</category></item><item><title>Day 32 - photo a day</title><link>/posts/2017/Feb/01/day-32-photo-a-day/</link><description>&lt;div&gt;

Woo, completed a month! Not sure how I'm going to manage another 11...
Anyway, a few(couple of?) months ago I lent a neighbour my bottle capper

I pre-ordered this cookbook at the beginning of January and it arrived

good looking recipes ranging from snack bars to evening meals. It should

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](&lt;http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie&gt;)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Today I went back to near Oswestry for a meal at Plas yn dinas in
Llanfechain with my family and my Dad's ladyfriend's family so that
everyone could meet one another (Elysia came with me too). It was good

Despite this being the view from the car park at the nant visitor centre

Lately I've been questioning if I eat enough calories during a normal
day. I tend to just eat two (big) meals a day plus a bit of fruit as a
snack once or twice too. I don't really like having breakfast early (as

New rubber! I've been riding 3.0" purgatorys on the ebike and whilst
theyre generally pretty good I wanted to try something more square in

I spent around 4 hours today in the woods, half of that was probably

wanted to share this one. It's a thai red curry and it's, frankly, just
