Another normal day, fog still doesn't seem to have lifted from
yesterday. Elysia was out tonight so I was sat in work wondering what to
eat and quite fancied cajun spiced tuna steak with crispy potatoes.

I actually did something different this evening, and totally forgot to
take a photo. At least it's something that'll happen again so I can get
it next time. Anyway, luckily I took a backup photo. The fantastic view
from the office today... This didn't lift for the entire day.

that interesting. Another day of same old, except today I baked a cake.
It's an orange cocoa cake, no eggs or milk or anything. It tastes really

I've spent most of today working on gamebuildr so haven't had anything
exciting to photo. Elysia got given some raw wool recently and she
started to sort it today, picking things like straw and twigs out and
then washing it. I briefly helped with the picking things out bit.
