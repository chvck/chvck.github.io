Tonight I went for my first night ride of 2017. It was warm and dry
although the ground was soaked so I got pretty wet anyway. Here's a

Today, Elysia and I went for another walk. This time we went to
Gogerddan woods to walk up the little hill. It was rather foggy so the

Yeah I forgot to post the photo again. For Christmas Elysia bought me a
mushroom log, these mushrooms are the first pickings. I think that
they're oyster mushrooms. They taste pretty good!
