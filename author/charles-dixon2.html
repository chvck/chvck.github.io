As I've done \~800km on the levo now I felt like it was probably about
(past) time to service the shock and forks. Nothing hugely involved,
just an air can service for the shock and lowers for the forks. After
doing the shock my bike developed an odd knocking word …</div>

This is getting difficult now, once again I've done nothing of interest
today so nothing interesting to photograph either. I started making the
needles for the giant wool blanket, it took me all of a minute but
that's what my photo is today. We still need to work out how …</div>

Not a whole lot to say about today... I left work quite late and picked

Went for a ride out to nant-y-moch today, it was really low which was
odd. I'm still wondering why. The new tyres feel pretty awesome,
definitely preferring them to the plus tyres.

You can probably imagine how happy I was to find cake recipes in the oms
cookbook. I had a flick through and decided to make an orange cake
although I also added some cocoa to it. It's nice and has the texture of
normal cake so definitely happy!

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie>)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.

Today I went back to near Oswestry for a meal at Plas yn dinas in
Llanfechain with my family and my Dad's ladyfriend's family so that
everyone could meet one another (Elysia came with me too). It was good
to meet them and they seem really nice. The food was …</div>

comic that was released the day that I was born. I used to read the
beano quite a lot and still have quite a few of the albums somewhere.
Little did they know that …</div>

Despite this being the view from the car park at the nant visitor centre
it's not one I often go to see. I don't tend to drive up there and when
I do it's to somewhere closer to home. I went out today to try out my
new tyres and …</div>

Lately I've been questioning if I eat enough calories during a normal
day. I tend to just eat two (big) meals a day plus a bit of fruit as a
snack once or twice too. I don't really like having breakfast early (as
in before work) it makes my feel …</div>

New rubber! I've been riding 3.0" purgatorys on the ebike and whilst
theyre generally pretty good I wanted to try something more square in
