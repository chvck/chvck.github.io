discussing which half of the body should be fish in a merman/mermaid and

Another normal day. This evening we made \[Moroccan spiced
pie\](<http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/2295/moroccan-spiced-pie>)
which was very nice. As Elysia can't eat nuts and I don't eat dairy I
changed the last step and just heated honey and mixed harissa paste into
it before pouring that mix over the pie.
