Well I was going to take a photo of the dismantled shock off my mega. It
doesn't appear to be the same shock as the tutorial and I think I'll
need a special adaptor to get air back in it if I remove the air so I
gave up on that. Hopefully tomorrow will be a photo from the new skills
area at<span
style="font-family: gotham, helvetica, arial, sans-serif; font-size: 14px;"></span>nant
anyway. Luckily I do have a backup! There are sewerage works happening
at work so the usual bike lockup is currently out of bounds, therefore I
had to lock my bike up elsewhere. This other bike rack has a pretty
decent view out over Morrisons and into the hills.

Another normal day, fog still doesn't seem to have lifted from
yesterday. Elysia was out tonight so I was sat in work wondering what to
eat and quite fancied cajun spiced tuna steak with crispy potatoes.
Turns out that tuna steak isn't so easy to come by these days, so …</div>

I actually did something different this evening, and totally forgot to
take a photo. At least it's something that'll happen again so I can get
it next time. Anyway, luckily I took a backup photo. The fantastic view
from the office today... This didn't lift for the entire day.

I've spent most of today working on gamebuildr so haven't had anything
exciting to photo. Elysia got given some raw wool recently and she
started to sort it today, picking things like straw and twigs out and
then washing it. I briefly helped with the picking things out bit.
