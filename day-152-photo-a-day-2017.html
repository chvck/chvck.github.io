	</div>

      <p>6 months into the year. That's gone quickly. I've not been sleeping right for a while now. My jawbone is telling me my deep sleep amount is well down, the majority of nights under 30 minutes. Whilst I take the figure itself with a pinch of salt I feel reasonably confident in believing the relative amounts over the months. It's now way down compared to what I was getting in March. It's hit the point where it is impacting on my well-being as I feel too tired in the evenings to do anything. I've decided I've got to do something about it, including throwing a bit of money at it. I don't want to go down the drugs route though. I've spent a bit of money on a blackout blind which should come next week and I'm trying to cut out screen time after 10 and then stretch/read until 11 when I'll go to sleep and then get up at 7. Bit of strictish routine should help I think. Until the black blind comes I have a makeshift solution... I got over double the amount of deep sleep as usual night but 1 night isn't a large enough sample size.</p>
