	</div>

      <p>Tonight I had a technical meeting with Boomer about moving our work to a more agile approach, from pretty much ad hoc. We met in Brynamlwg which is the only pub at the top of the hill, it used to be members only but is now open to all. It's a nice enough place, feels like a proper pub and the staff are friendly. The beer prices are slightly less friendly at Â£3.50 a bottle but I guess being the only pub up here they can do that. The only other bars are the union and the art centre, the union has sticky floors and is, obviously, very studenty. I don't imagine the art centre being any cheaper.

We're going to try adopt a kanban meets scrum approach, something akin to scumban but maybe a bit less formal and scrum-esque. There's no review with stakeholders, because there are none, but we will do planning and retrospective albeit in the same meeting. Scrums are a no-go, we work independent ad-hoc hours and they're probably just not necessary for us as we have a really good line of communication and discuss everything anyway. I guess that we are loosely following scrum but we've cut it back a bit to suit our needs.</p>
